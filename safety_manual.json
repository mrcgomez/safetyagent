This commitment is reflected in everything we do from initial employee training to the installation, operation, and maintenance of our utility infrastructure, and in how we provide safe and reliable service to our 22 million customers.\nThe Company and employees must comply with all applicable federal, state, regional, municipal, and local laws, ordinances, rules, codes, regulations, and executive orders as well as SoCalGas policies and standards.\nMessage from Leadership\nWe are Safer Together advancing a culture that empowers communication, curiosity, commitment, and collaboration.\nSoCalGas is fully committed to safety as a core value. SoCalGas’s leadership is responsible for overseeing reported safety concerns and promoting a strong, healthy safety culture and an environment of trust that includes empowering all employees to identify and mitigate risks and hazards and to “Stop-the-Job” if they cannot be sufficiently mitigated.\nUse Instructions\nThe Safety Manual for Employees provides an overview of SoCalGas’ safety culture, policies, and procedures. It is intended as a reference guide and does not replace official company standards or procedures. Many sections are summarized, with links to more detailed documentation for specific processes and procedures.\nAs an employee of SoCalGas, you are expected to be curious and ask questions, collaborate on improving our safety manual, field guides, resources, policies, and procedures, and communicate any safety suggestions or issues, and commit to safety for everyone.\nSome links in this manual depend on having access to the internet and internal SoCalGas resources. Review all relevant safety information before going into the field where access to the internet may be unreliable.\nThe key to continuous improvement is receiving your feedback. Your input is valuable in ensuring your safety, your coworkers’ safety, and the safety of our communities.\nClick the link to share your ideas: Safety Suggestion Submission Form. Suggestions are assigned to a responsible person who will follow-up with the submitter.\nThe Safety Organization updates the Manual and associated safety guidelines and policies annually.\n",

      "content": "1. SoCalGas’ Approach to Safety\nCommunication team will add Executive Messaging.\nExample: At SoCalGas, comprehensive safety means being relentless about identifying and mitigating risk. It also means protecting you, the communities we serve, our infrastructure, and our contractor partners.\n- Cedric Williams, Chief Safety Officer\nThe following sections define and clarify SoCalGas’s approach to Safety, a combination of policies, programs, documentation, and training that work together to help every employee focus on a new and expanded view of Safety.\nDefinition of Safety\nSoCalGas defines safety as the presence of controls for known hazards, actions to anticipate and guard against unknown hazards, and the commitment to continuously improve our ability to recognize and mitigate hazards.\"\nSoCalGas’ strives to view safety comprehensively, and takes a broad, proactive approach, reaching beyond ‘compliance only’ thinking.\nWhile compliance is important, safety is more than blindly following the rules. We look at safety holistically. Including the EPIC principles (Employee safety, Public safety, Infrastructure safety, and Contractor safety) and other elements such as environmental, process safety, cyber security, and asset security.\nWe do not achieve safety by simply removing a short-term risk or implementing an immediate corrective action focused on a specific situation. We assess and respond to each and every situation and use that assessment to strengthen systems, processes, planning, and operations to prevent future incidents.\nWe understand that true safety comes from continuously building capacity, resilience, and adding positive elements that make us ready for tomorrow.\nSafety Culture\nA company's culture refers to the shared values, beliefs, behaviors, and norms that shape how employees interact, make decisions, and work together within an organization. It’s often described as “how things are done around here.”\nOur Culture North Star – We are Safer Together when we know the system, know our roles and know when to act.\nSafer Together represents the “how” - our values, beliefs, norms, and behaviors.\nTogether, the Safety Management System (SMS) and our culture support our commitment to safety and shape how we communicate, collaborate, and show curiosity by asking “why.” It is essential that our guiding documents and our culture work in tandem to drive meaningful safety outcomes.\nEmployee, Public, Infrastructure, Contractor Safety (EPIC)\nSafety is everything we do across the enterprise. From office support roles to work in the field, we seek to recognize and mitigate hazards and keep our Employees, the Public, our Infrastructure, and our Contractors safe. The focus of many safety programs is on the personal safety of employees. However, there are multiple facets to safety that are foundational to our ability to deliver energy SAFELY to California. When we shift our meaning of safety to, everything we do, every day, it reflects that we all have a role in safety and safety outcomes.\nPsychological Safety\nPsychological Safety is the belief that your voice, and every person’s voice, is welcomed and valued, and that work-related concerns, ideas, or questions can be raised without fear of embarrassment, punishment, or other negative outcomes.\nAt SoCalGas, we promote a Speak-Up culture where everyone is encouraged to share ideas, call out unsafe conditions, such as Stop-the-Job actions, and contribute to improvement efforts. We encourage employees to speak up when in meetings or town halls. The concerns of our employees need to be heard to promote a culture of safety where every voice matters.\nA curious and collaborative environment is supported by our safety champions and local safety committees and reinforced during planning, training, and staff meetings as well as safety-focused meetings such as Tailgate Safety Briefings.\nPsychological safety boosts engagement, strengthens collaboration, and encourages open communication. When employees feel safe to speak up and ask questions, creativity and productivity thrive -leading to more innovative and effective teams.\nStop-the-Job (STJ) Policy\nThe Stop-The-Job policy requires a culture of psychological safety and ethical standards and empowers employees to speak up about potential hazards by stopping the job when a hazardous condition or unsafe action is observed.\nAll Company employees have the responsibility to respect and adhere to any decision to Stop-the-Job. No one should fear reprisal simply for stopping a job in good faith. Under no circumstances will retaliation of any kind be directed toward any employee who in good faith exercises their authority to Stop-the-Job. The company recognizes that people are fallible and blame fixes nothing.\nAll Company employees, contractors, and visitors have the authority and responsibility to stop any work activity that poses a risk (encountering a hazardous condition or unsafe act) that could endanger Employees, the Public, our gas Infrastructure including equipment and facilities, or Contractors (EPIC).\n",

HOP is not about placing blame; it is about understanding why an incident or event happened in the first place.

By examining all the factors involved, we aim to create safer and more efficient processes.\n",

      "content": "Error is normal: People make mistakes, and it is a normal part of the human condition to forget things or lose focus. Instead of trying to be “error free” we should strive to create better conditions for work and systems that allow us to fail safely without causing a catastrophe.\nBlame fixes nothing: Blaming or judging an employee for an error gets in the way of learning and developing as an organization. People will not be forthcoming with details that we can learn from if they are blamed for the error.\nContext drives behavior: When we talk about context driving behavior, we mean that people’s actions make sense in the environment and conditions under which they work. If we ask the right questions and are curious enough, we will see why an error occurred and how choices made led to the actions taken. So instead of placing blame, let’s ask questions to learn the “why” of the situation.\nLearning is vital: Learning is vital and goes hand in hand with context driving behavior and blame fixing nothing. Instead of looking for someone to blame, ask questions to find out about the context of the situation and discover the reason behind the behavior so we learn from and share this with others. We cannot change the system if we don’t learn from past behaviors.\nResponse matters: We often react to a situation in an automatic fashion by looking for someone or something to blame, or by not giving the situation the attention it deserves. This blocks us from really learning from experiences. Responding to errors by asking questions and looking into the context of the situation allows us to learn more about how to improve conditions and make things safer for everyone.\nBlack Line/Blue Line Analysis\nIn the context of operational safety in the gas industry, the Black Line / Blue Line graph is a conceptual tool used to illustrate the difference between \"Work as Planned\" and \"Work as Done.”\n",

The SMS is a system that helps everyone -from top management to front-line employees -working together to prevent incidents and keep people and our infrastructure safe. It includes clear policies, procedures, and tools for identifying hazards, reporting issues, and continuously improving safety practices. SMS also defines roles and responsibilities and promotes collaboration across the enterprise by breaking down silos.

They are close to the work being performed and are professionals in what they do. As your peers, they care about doing the job safely and helping others do the same.\nThey lead by example, speak up about safety, and encourage others to do the right thing.\nThey help identify areas for improvement and share ideas that can make work safer and more efficient.\nThey work closely with local leadership, safety advocates, and safety champions to share feedback from their workgroups and spread important safety messages.\nMembers of the Safety Committees aren’t responsible for making all the changes themselves, but they are go-to people in their area who keep safety as a priority and make sure voices are heard.\nSafety Committees are established to promote a safe and healthy work environment by identifying and addressing safety concerns, fostering communication between employees and leadership, and ensuring compliance with safety regulations and best practices.\nSafety Committees promote the idea that employee, public, infrastructure, and contractor safety (EPIC) is everyone’s responsibility.\nClick the link for additional information: Guidelines for Establishing District and Department Safety Committees\nSafety Champion Network\nSafety Champions are a diverse selection of key and influential management employees from across the Company that enhance the development and enterprise-wide adoption and integration of safety fundamentals, culture, and initiatives.\nSafety Champions represent various operational and functional departments and are ambassadors for safety, influence by example, identify opportunities for improvement, and inspire others to make positive changes. Safety Champions serve a vital role in the development, implementation, and enhancement of organizational safety processes.\nThese individuals are not necessarily responsible for the changes themselves but serve as points of contact from around the organization to partner with the SMS Organization in cultivating engagement within their specific group or function.\n2.

      "content": "Job Site Safety Plan\nA Job Site Safety Plan (JSSP) serves as a comprehensive safety framework designed to guide all operations on a jobsite throughout the duration of a project. It is particularly essential for large-scale or long-term projects where multiple teams and contractors are involved. The JSSP ensures that safety practices are consistent, thorough, and aligned with regulatory standards, providing a centralized reference for all safety-related procedures and expectations.\nThe plan promotes a coordinated and compliant approach to safety by incorporating structured processes such as Task Safety Briefings (TSBs) and Job Hazard or Safety Analyses (JHA/JSA). These tools help identify and mitigate risks associated with specific tasks and ensure that all personnel are aware of potential hazards before work begins. The JSSP is a living document that evolves with the project and must be formally documented and signed by leadership, including general contractors and safety managers, to demonstrate accountability and commitment to a safe work environment.\nKey components of the JSSP include the identification of site-specific hazards, clearly defined roles and responsibilities, and detailed emergency response procedures. It also outlines training requirements and communication protocols to ensure that all workers are informed, prepared, and engaged in maintaining a safe job site. These elements work together to create a proactive safety culture that minimizes risk and enhances overall project efficiency.\n",

It takes about 20 seconds to complete.\nLoss of focus after completing the Circle of Safety may be a factor in collisions with stationary objects. This may result from doing other tasks such as viewing a cell phone during the Circle or doing other tasks between completing the circle and driving off.\nChecking for locked bins, correctly secured loads, trailer hitch attachments, etc. are completed prior to beginning the Circle, not during. This will keep the focus on recognizing possible hazards and allow the driver to eliminate or avoid them.\nThe Circle of Safety applies to every stop, every place, every day.

These incidents may require resources beyond that of a local incident evaluation.\nRefer to the Event Learning Process (ELP) GS 223.0032, Event Learning Process (ELP), for additional information regarding root cause analysis methods for major incidents.\nDoctor Visit Incidents\nDoctor visit is when an employee receives any level of treatment from an external medical source (e.g., external industrial clinic, urgent care, hospital, or paramedics). If an employee with a previously reported first-aid injury requests medical attention due to the same incident or states they cannot work or perform their job; treat the injury as a \"Doctor Visit,\" update SIMS as appropriate, and contact Employee Care Services (ECS). ECS will determine if the injury is \"OSHA Recordable\".\nFirst Aid Incidents\nFirst Aid is an injury or illness that is minor in nature or could require a doctor's care in the future. The affected employee, another trained employee, or internal OHN service provider can render first aid care. Supervisors must evaluate minor injuries to identify actions that can be taken to prevent a more serious injury from occurring in the future. This is done through a Safety Review Period where OHN, Supervisor and the affected employees work together to ensure successful first aid care and use of administrative control to prevent discomfort or injury from becoming more severe.\nSupervisors must follow up with an injured employee to see if they require further medical treatment regularly. Ask if the employee would like to: see an OHN, go to an industrial clinic, see their personal doctor, or if they have already been evaluated by a doctor. Immediately notify Employee Care Services (ECS) if the injured employee has seen, or plans to see, an industrial clinic or personal doctor.\nReport Only Incidents\nAn incident occurrence where the employee made direct contact with object and could have sustained an injury or illness but does not currently require First Aid (minor injury) or medical treatment. If an employee declines medical treatment, document the injury or illness in SIMS as \"Report Only\".\nLost Time Incidents\nInjuries that prevent employees from reporting to work for their next scheduled shift (the workday after the day the injury occurred) are classified as \"Lost Time Incidents.\" All Lost Time Incidents are also OSHA Recordable incidents.\nOSHA Recordable Incidents\nEmployee Care Services (ECS) will determine if an injury that resulted in a Doctor Visit is OSHA Recordable based upon standards established by the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Cal-OSHA).\nCalifornia Public Utility Commission (CPUC) / Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) Incidents\nFor incidents involving pipeline related emergencies, refer to GS 183.07, Pipeline Incident Reports to CPUC and PHMSA; National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Accident Investigation.\nMotor Vehicle Incident (MVI)\nA motor vehicle incident (MVI) is an event involving a Company owned or leased/rental motor vehicle that results in death, injury, or property damage.\nReporting exceptions for an MVI as determined by local management, supervisor, and Field Safety Advisor (FSA):\nA vehicle that is properly and legally parked.\nNo damage to Company property, Company vehicle or 3rd parties.\nThe use of a Company owned or leased/rental vehicle was for personal use during the incident.\nAll motor vehicle incidents are initially categorized as MVIs until the incident evaluation is complete and the Field Safety Advisor and Supervisor agree on a classification which will be one of the following:\nControllable Motor Vehicle Incident (CMVI) - is a motor vehicle incident over which the driver had control (could have prevented). Any employee contribution to the incident causes the incident to be \"controllable.”\nIf the driver did not do everything reasonably possible to prevent the incident, it is defined as \"controllable\" and should have been prevented.\nDe Minimis - is a classification that includes CMVIs. This classification was developed to provide \"statistical relief\" from incidents over which there is no injury, no 3rd party property damage and damage to Company property is less than $1,000.\nThe $1,000 value is consistent with California Vehicle Code (CVC) requiring traffic accidents on a California street/highway or private property to be reported to the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) if there was an injury, death, or property damage in excess of $1,000.\nNon-Controllable Motor Vehicle Incident (NC-MVI) - is an incident involving a motor vehicle that is deemed beyond the control of the driver (the driver could not prevent it).\nLegal liability or \"fault\" is not a primary consideration in determining controllability.\nThe possibility that other causes for an incident exist is not considered proof an employee could not have prevented an incident.\nIncidents that occur at drive-thru establishments are considered \"controllable.\"\nVehicles involved in incidents that occur in parking lots and on private property must have been there for Company business. Lunch (other than approved business lunches) and breaks are not considered Company business.\nEXCEPTION: In areas where there is no available street parking within 100 yards (about a ninety-second walk), at supervisor discretion employees may park Company owned or leased/rental vehicles in remote parking lot areas.\nAny damage to, or caused by, a Company vehicle or personal vehicle being used for company business must be documented on Form 439 and submitted to the Claims department. The incident evaluation results must be documented in SIMS.\nReference: American National Standards Institute ANSI D.16-2017: Manual on Classification of Motor Vehicle Traffic Crashes.\nSerious Injury or Fatality (SIF) Potential Program\nSoCalGas adopted the Edison Electric Institute (EEI) Safety Classification and Learning (SCL) Model to help in the identification and classification of potential serious injuries and fatalities. This model supports a common understanding of safety learning opportunities.\nIncidents classified as Potential Serious Injury or Fatality (PSIF) are further evaluated by trained PSIF Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). Safety Management make the final PSIF determination. When PSIFs have been identified they are reviewed for learning prioritization.\nSuggested edits: PSIFs event will be evaluated through the Incident Evaluation Process, refer to IIPP.7, Appendices, Appendix D. If a deep dive is warranted, they will proceed through the Event Learning Process, refer to OS 223.0032 for details.\nThe identification and enhanced evaluation process allows for PSIF prioritization of incident causal factors to determine corrective actions that significantly mitigate employee exposure to SIFs.\nThe following four questions must be answered to determine PSIF classification.\nWhich high-energy was present?\nWas there a high-energy event?\nWas a serious injury sustained?\nWas a direct control present?\nPSIF training is available for Supervisors through My Learning.\nIncident Evaluation\nSafety Incidents are employee injuries and illnesses and motor vehicle incidents. Types of injuries and illnesses include doctor visits, first aid incident, report only. Motor vehicles incidents include controllable, non-controllable, de minimis. Other Events also include Good Catches, Near Misses, Stop-the-Jobs.\nSupervisors are responsible for thoroughly evaluating incidents and identifying all contributing factors. Supervisors together with the other incident evaluation team members determine the corrective actions that will be implemented to prevent similar incidents from reoccurring.\nSupervisors are responsible for evaluating every employee injury/illness or hazardous materials exposure and Motor Vehicle Incidents (MVIs). Other events may also trigger an evaluation and follow-up such as a Good Catch, Near Miss or Stop-The-Job. Some minor incidents may not merit an incident evaluation, consult with your Field Safety Advisor.\nSupervisors are responsible for establishing an incident evaluation team, minimally comprised of the immediate supervisor, the supervisor's manager, the involved employee, another employee (preferably from the local Safety Committee or Union), and a Safety department representative. The department head must be invited to participate when the incident resulted in lost time, restricted duty, or significant property damage.\nSupervisors refer to IIPP.7, Appendices, Appendix D, and the “Incident Evaluation Guide\" for more detailed information.\nIncident Evaluation Tree\nAn incident evaluation must be completed for each safety incident (injury/illness, MVI). Other events may also trigger an evaluation such as a Good Catch, Near Miss or Stop-the-Job. This includes creating a Cause Analysis Tree and uploading the report in SIMS.\nSome minor incidents may merit an incident evaluation, consult with your Field Safety Advisor.\nConduct the evaluation as soon as possible, while the facts are still fresh in people’s minds and the incident site is relatively unchanged. Prompt evaluations demonstrate that you place a high value on safety,\nFor more information on the incident evaluation process refer to: IIPP.7, Appendices, Appendix D Incident Evaluation Guide.\nTraining for Incident evaluation is available through My Learning.\nDrug or Alcohol Abuse\nIf there is a reasonable suspicion of substance abuse, employees supervisors must contact a Wellness Programs representative.\nGood Catch\nThere are many benefits to reporting Good Catches or Near Misses and sharing them with others. Understanding the causes of these events and, more importantly, the actions that can be taken to prevent them from recurring, provide the opportunity to prevent injuries and incidents.\nThese events can be shared by entering them into the Safety Information Management System (SIMS).\nGood Catch: A Good Catch is an observation, event or situation that has the potential to cause injury, illness, or property damage, but did not occur thanks to timely intervention by an engaged individual or the presence of an effective control.\nA Good Catch is when you see something and correct it immediately.\nA Good Catch can prevent a Near Miss or Stop-The-Job.\n",

If the exposed employee opts to take the vaccine, the supervisor ensures the employee is taken or goes to the nearest Industrial Clinic or OHN office within 24 hours of the Incident. Employees who decline the vaccine must fill out the form entitled Hepatitis B Vaccine Declination and return to ECS.\nIf an employee initially declines the vaccination and subsequently requests it, the supervisor arranges for the employee to receive it as soon as possible.\nContaminated Clothing\nImmediately remove clothing contaminated by blood or other body fluids using plastic gloves provided in first aid kits. Put contaminated clothing in a plastic bag and seal.\nContact your Environmental Compliance Specialist for specific instructions on decontamination or disposal of the contaminated clothing.\nPayment for Vaccines\nContact Employee Care Services (ECS) for review, documentation of the incident and payment of services to clinic.\nTraining on blood borne pathogens is done as part of employee first aid training.\n166.08 - CPR/AED, Bloodborne Pathogens and First Aid Standard\nHeat Illness Protection Program (Indoor and Outdoor)\nProtect employees from heat illnesses while performing outdoor work by providing heat illness training, specifying drinking water and shade requirements, and providing emergency procedures as needed.\n",

If a supervisor suspects noise levels are at these levels (general rule of thumb you need to shout at a distance of 3 feet to be heard), and the job classification is not in the program, contact your Field Safety Advisor to request an evaluation.\nAdditional information including the job classification list in the program can be found on the Safety SharePoint site: Programs/Hearing Conservation and GS 166.04, Hearing Conservation Program.\nRespiratory Protection Program\nSupervisors are responsible for ensuring all employees in the Respiratory Protection Program complete their medical pre-screening (which includes a medical questionnaire and spirometry testing), receive respirator training, and are fit-tested to wear a respirator. Respirators are worn to control exposure to airborne hazards which can include dusts, fibers, fumes, mists, gases, vapors, biological material, and oxygen deficient atmospheres.\nAdditional information including a list of job classification in the program and operations where respirators are required can be found on the Safety SharePoint site: Respirator Program and in GS 104.06, Respiratory Protection Program.\nAsbestos and Lead Exposure\nSupervisors are responsible for prohibiting employees from removing or disturbing asbestos materials.\nException: Employees with proper training and equipment may remove brake shoes, brake clutches, gaskets, and less than 100 square feet of asbestos coal tar pipe wrap. See Environmental & Safety GS 104.05, Asbestos Management.\nWhen asbestos materials are encountered, supervisors are to contact Environmental Services for the removal of asbestos or lead. Environmental Services has blanket contracts with abatement contractors and industrial hygiene consultants whose services will be used for this purpose.\nSupervisors are responsible for prohibiting employees from removing or disturbing paint containing lead or other metals. Assume all paint contains lead or other metals.\nException: Employees with proper training and equipment may remove less than 100 sq. ft. of paint containing lead or other metals using specific work controls and methods, or use lead-containing materials such as packing, sealants, and anti-seize compounds. See Safety GS 167.30, Lead and Metals in Surface Coatings and Other Sources: Hazard Compliance Program.\nInfectious Materials\nEmployees must avoid contact with potentially infectious materials such as animal carcasses, sewage, bio-solids, syringes, and liquids or surfaces contaminated by human or animal blood, waste or fluids, or respiratory aerosols/droplets.\nRequirements for protection against infectious agents transmitted in respiratory aerosols/droplets are outlined in the appendix, Infectious Materials.\nPublic Safety\nAt SoCalGas, we have a critical responsibility to protect the communities we serve. Every employee plays a vital role in ensuring public safety by adhering to established safety protocols, promptly reporting hazards, and maintaining clear communication with both internal teams and the public. Whether responding to a gas leak, performing routine maintenance, or working near populated areas, employees must remain vigilant and prioritize the well-being of the public at all times.\nEmployees are expected to follow all safety signage, secure work zones, and use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) to prevent accidents and minimize risk. In the event of an emergency, such as a suspected gas leak or fire, employees must follow emergency response procedures, notify the appropriate authorities, and assist in evacuating the area if necessary.\nPublic trust is built on our commitment to safety, and every action we take reflects our dedication to protecting lives and property.\nNOTE: Inconvenience to the Public must not be given priority and/or precedence over Employee and/or Public Safety\nFall Hazards\nFall hazards pose a serious risk not only to employees but also to the public, especially in areas where utility work is conducted near sidewalks, streets, or other accessible locations. All employees must take proactive steps to prevent slips, trips, and falls by maintaining clean, organized work areas and securing tools and materials. When working at heights or near open trenches, proper fall protection equipment must be used, and barriers or warning signs should be clearly placed to keep the public at a safe distance.\nAny unsafe conditions, such as uneven surfaces or unsecured ladders, must be addressed immediately. By staying alert and following fall prevention protocols, we help ensure a safe environment for everyone in the vicinity of our operations.\nJob Site Intrusion\nJobsite intrusions present a significant safety risk to both employees and the public. Unauthorized individuals entering active work zones can be exposed to hazardous conditions such as open trenches, pressurized gas lines, heavy equipment, and other dangers.\nTo prevent intrusions, all job sites must be clearly marked with appropriate signage, barriers, and, when necessary, flaggers or security personnel. Employees should remain alert and report any unauthorized entry immediately to a supervisor. Engaging with intruders should be done calmly and professionally, prioritizing safety and de-escalation. Maintaining a secure perimeter not only protects the public but also ensures that work can proceed safely and without interruption.\n3. People Leaders\nEmployee Safety Training and Safety meetings (Supervisor)\nConducting Employee Safety Training and Safety Meetings\nSupervisors must ensure each employee under their supervision are well trained, able to recognize job hazards, implement appropriate controls, and understand how to perform assigned tasks safely. Employee training must be documented in our system of record: Learning Management System (LMS)\n1. General Safety Training\nThe law requires the Company to provide safety training for its employees.

Supervisors must readily use their knowledge and authority to correct at-risk conditions or actions. At-risk conditions or actions refer to behaviors or events that increase the likelihood of accidents, injuries, or negative outcomes.\nSupervisors must understand gas standards and safety regulations and stay informed of changes affecting the operations they supervise.\nSupervisors are responsible for regularly inspecting employee work practices and taking action to correct any at-risk conditions or behaviors. Job Safety Observation checklists can be used to document Supervisor observations, conditions or actions requiring modification, and corrective actions.\nJob Safety Observations help Supervisors identify and measure safe and at-risk work site conditions and employee actions compared to established criteria. Safety recommends that Supervisors perform a minimum of two Job Safety Observations on every frontline employee a year. However, Job Safety Observations should be performed as often as the Supervisor deems necessary to be confident hazardous conditions are identified and controls are in place. Supervisor Job Safety Observations provide an opportunity for employees to receive feedback regarding hazard identification, employee actions, and coaching as to how to perform work tasks safely.\nEnvironmental Safety Compliance Management Program (ESCMP)\nThe State of California requires regularly scheduled workplace inspections.

Additional protective garments and equipment, such as a half face air purifying respirator with a P100 filter, must be used if ingestion and/or inhalation are possible routes of exposure (refer to GS 104.06 Respiratory Protection Program). Additional protective measures may also be needed in the event of a declared public health emergency regarding animal disposal.\n4.\tScoop or place contaminated material in suitable containers. Animal carcasses should be wetted with a bleach solution (1 ½ cup of household bleach per gallon of water) and placed in double-layered 6-mil plastic bags. IMPORTANT: DO NOT TOUCH, MOVE, OR BLEACH AN EAGLE CARCASS! Instead, immediately contact Environmental Services Natural Resources staff.\n5.\tContaminated work surfaces and tools must be disinfected with chlorine bleach solution (1 ½ cups of household bleach per gallon of water) or other disinfectants before work continues by unprotected employees. Disinfectants must be adequately removed or rinsed to prevent skin irritation.\n6.\tEmployees must use good personal hygiene, including washing hands with soap and water before eating, drinking, smoking, or leaving the work area.\n7.\tContaminated clothes should be machine washed separately in hot water, detergent, and household bleach.\n8.\tIf an employee is just near sewage, there is no exposure. If an employee is exposed to sewage through eyes, skin, or cut, follow these procedures:\na)\tNotify the supervisor as soon as practical\nb)\tImmediately remove contaminated clothing.\nc)\tDo not take clothing home; put it in a plastic bag for routine laundering.\nd)\tSoak clothing in (1½ cups of bleach per gallon of water) for 30 minutes before sending it to the laundry.\ne)\tWash boots with soap and water as soon as possible.\nf)\tWash hands and affected area with soap and water as soon as possible. In the field, use the waterless hand cleaner (\"Scrub in a Bucket\") immediately.\ng)\tWash with soap and water as soon as possible. Avoid touching mouth, eyes, or food until washing.\n9.\tSewage Treatment Plant bio-solids are usually the dry-treated solids from the plants that have been spread on the soil. During routine work activities around bio-solids, follow these guidelines:\na)\tNever eat, drink, or smoke between handling bio-solid and washing hands\nb)\tDon't smoke, chew tobacco or gum while working in the area\nc)\tAvoid touching the face or eyes before washing hands\nd)\tKeep cuts covered\n",

This manual encourages a questioning and learning environment and a comprehensive view of safety including the EPIC principles (Employee safety, Public safety, Infrastructure safety, and Contractor safety) and other elements such as environmental, process safety, cyber security, and asset security. The ”EPIC” acronym reminds all employees executives, managers, supervisors, represented and management employees, to think beyond personal safety, beyond “accidents,” and take a broader look at what “Safety” means. Safety is what we do every day and is the foundation of who we are. This commitment is reflected in everything we do from initial employee training to the installation, operation, and maintenance of our utility infrastructure, and in how we provide safe and reliable service to our 22 million customers. The Company and employees must comply with all applicable federal, state, regional, municipal, and local laws, ordinances, rules, codes, regulations, and executive orders as well as SoCalGas policies and standards. Message from Leadership We are Safer Together advancing a culture that empowers communication, curiosity, commitment, and collaboration. SoCalGas is fully committed to safety as a core value. SoCalGas’s leadership is responsible for overseeing reported safety concerns and promoting a strong, healthy safety culture and an environment of trust that includes empowering all employees to identify and mitigate risks and hazards and to “Stop-the-Job” if they cannot be sufficiently mitigated. Use Instructions The Safety Manual for Employees provides an overview of SoCalGas’ safety culture, policies, and procedures. It is intended as a reference guide and does not replace official company standards or procedures. Many sections are summarized, with links to more detailed documentation for specific processes and procedures. As an employee of SoCalGas, you are expected to be curious and ask questions, collaborate on improving our safety manual, field guides, resources, policies, and procedures, and communicate any safety suggestions or issues, and commit to safety for everyone. Some links in this manual depend on having access to the internet and internal SoCalGas resources. Review all relevant safety information before going into the field where access to the internet may be unreliable. The key to continuous improvement is receiving your feedback. Your input is valuable in ensuring your safety, your coworkers’ safety, and the safety of our communities. Click the link to share your ideas: Safety Suggestion Submission Form. Suggestions are assigned to a responsible person who will follow-up with the submitter. The Safety Organization updates the Manual and associated safety guidelines and policies annually.",

Example: At SoCalGas, comprehensive safety means being relentless about identifying and mitigating risk. It also means protecting you, the communities we serve, our infrastructure, and our contractor partners. - Cedric Williams, Chief Safety Officer The following sections define and clarify SoCalGas’s approach to Safety, a combination of policies, programs, documentation, and training that work together to help every employee focus on a new and expanded view of Safety. Definition of Safety SoCalGas defines safety as the presence of controls for known hazards, actions to anticipate and guard against unknown hazards, and the commitment to continuously improve our ability to recognize and mitigate hazards.\" SoCalGas’ strives to view safety comprehensively, and takes a broad, proactive approach, reaching beyond ‘compliance only’ thinking. While compliance is important, safety is more than blindly following the rules. We look at safety holistically. Including the EPIC principles (Employee safety, Public safety, Infrastructure safety, and Contractor safety) and other elements such as environmental, process safety, cyber security, and asset security. We do not achieve safety by simply removing a short-term risk or implementing an immediate corrective action focused on a specific situation. We assess and respond to each and every situation and use that assessment to strengthen systems, processes, planning, and operations to prevent future incidents. We understand that true safety comes from continuously building capacity, resilience, and adding positive elements that make us ready for tomorrow. Safety Culture A company's culture refers to the shared values, beliefs, behaviors, and norms that shape how employees interact, make decisions, and work together within an organization. It’s often described as “how things are done around here.” Our Culture North Star – We are Safer Together when we know the system, know our roles and know when to act. Safer Together represents the “how” - our values, beliefs, norms, and behaviors. Together, the Safety Management System (SMS) and our culture support our commitment to safety and shape how we communicate, collaborate, and show curiosity by asking “why.” It is essential that our guiding documents and our culture work in tandem to drive meaningful safety outcomes. Employee, Public, Infrastructure, Contractor Safety (EPIC) Safety is everything we do across the enterprise. From office support roles to work in the field, we seek to recognize and mitigate hazards and keep our Employees, the Public, our Infrastructure, and our Contractors safe. The focus of many safety programs is on the personal safety of employees. However, there are multiple facets to safety that are foundational to our ability to deliver energy SAFELY to California. When we shift our meaning of safety to, everything we do, every day, it reflects that we all have a role in safety and safety outcomes. Psychological Safety Psychological Safety is the belief that your voice, and every person’s voice, is welcomed and valued, and that work-related concerns, ideas, or questions can be raised without fear of embarrassment, punishment, or other negative outcomes. At SoCalGas, we promote a Speak-Up culture where everyone is encouraged to share ideas, call out unsafe conditions, such as Stop-the-Job actions, and contribute to improvement efforts. We encourage employees to speak up when in meetings or town halls. The concerns of our employees need to be heard to promote a culture of safety where every voice matters. A curious and collaborative environment is supported by our safety champions and local safety committees and reinforced during planning, training, and staff meetings as well as safety-focused meetings such as Tailgate Safety Briefings. Psychological safety boosts engagement, strengthens collaboration, and encourages open communication. When employees feel safe to speak up and ask questions, creativity and productivity thrive -leading to more innovative and effective teams. Stop-the-Job (STJ) Policy The Stop-The-Job policy requires a culture of psychological safety and ethical standards and empowers employees to speak up about potential hazards by stopping the job when a hazardous condition or unsafe action is observed. All Company employees have the responsibility to respect and adhere to any decision to Stop-the-Job. No one should fear reprisal simply for stopping a job in good faith. Under no circumstances will retaliation of any kind be directed toward any employee who in good faith exercises their authority to Stop-the-Job. The company recognizes that people are fallible and blame fixes nothing. All Company employees, contractors, and visitors have the authority and responsibility to stop any work activity that poses a risk (encountering a hazardous condition or unsafe act) that could endanger Employees, the Public, our gas Infrastructure including equipment and facilities, or Contractors (EPIC).",

      "content": "Error is normal: People make mistakes, and it is a normal part of the human condition to forget things or lose focus. Instead of trying to be “error free” we should strive to create better conditions for work and systems that allow us to fail safely without causing a catastrophe. Blame fixes nothing: Blaming or judging an employee for an error gets in the way of learning and developing as an organization. People will not be forthcoming with details that we can learn from if they are blamed for the error. Context drives behavior: When we talk about context driving behavior, we mean that people’s actions make sense in the environment and conditions under which they work. If we ask the right questions and are curious enough, we will see why an error occurred and how choices made led to the actions taken. So instead of placing blame, let’s ask questions to learn the “why” of the situation. Learning is vital: Learning is vital and goes hand in hand with context driving behavior and blame fixing nothing. Instead of looking for someone to blame, ask questions to find out about the context of the situation and discover the reason behind the behavior so we learn from and share this with others. We cannot change the system if we don’t learn from past behaviors. Response matters: We often react to a situation in an automatic fashion by looking for someone or something to blame, or by not giving the situation the attention it deserves. This blocks us from really learning from experiences. Responding to errors by asking questions and looking into the context of the situation allows us to learn more about how to improve conditions and make things safer for everyone.

Safety Management System (SMS) The Safety Management System (SMS) is a structured framework with established roles and responsibilities used to manage safety comprehensively, systematically, and in an integrated manner. The SMS is a system that helps everyone -from top management to front-line employees -working together to prevent incidents and keep people and our infrastructure safe. It includes clear policies, procedures, and tools for identifying hazards, reporting issues, and continuously improving safety practices. SMS also defines roles and responsibilities and promotes collaboration across the enterprise by breaking down silos. Simply put, the SMS is everything we do to keep everyone and everything safe. The Safety Manual for Employees support operational controls as discussed in the SMS. When it comes to safety, SMS is the “what” - our procedures, processes, programs, and policies. Link to SMS Manual when published. Safety Governance and Committees Executive Safety Council The Executive Safety Council (ESC) provides leadership guidance in fostering a proactive safety culture where risk identification and mitigation, management review, and continuous improvement are considered in support of SoCalGas’ Safety Management System (SMS). The ESC monitors safety performance, promotes alignment with API RP 1173, and oversees the Safety Management System (SMS) to sustain implementation, improve risk management, and drive continuous improvement. Local and Regional Safety Committees Safety Committees are made up of team members from different departments within a facility, district, or organization, who work together to help strengthen the company’s safety culture. They are close to the work being performed and are professionals in what they do. As your peers, they care about doing the job safely and helping others do the same. They lead by example, speak up about safety, and encourage others to do the right thing. They help identify areas for improvement and share ideas that can make work safer and more efficient. They work closely with local leadership, safety advocates, and safety champions to share feedback from their workgroups and spread important safety messages. Members of the Safety Committees aren’t responsible for making all the changes themselves, but they are go-to people in their area who keep safety as a priority and make sure voices are heard. Safety Committees are established to promote a safe and healthy work environment by identifying and addressing safety concerns, fostering communication between employees and leadership, and ensuring compliance with safety regulations and best practices. Safety Committees promote the idea that employee, public, infrastructure, and contractor safety (EPIC) is everyone’s responsibility. Click the link for additional information: Guidelines for Establishing District and Department Safety Committees Safety Champion Network Safety Champions are a diverse selection of key and influential management employees from across the Company that enhance the development and enterprise-wide adoption and integration of safety fundamentals, culture, and initiatives. Safety Champions represent various operational and functional departments and are ambassadors for safety, influence by example, identify opportunities for improvement, and inspire others to make positive changes. Safety Champions serve a vital role in the development, implementation, and enhancement of organizational safety processes. These individuals are not necessarily responsible for the changes themselves but serve as points of contact from around the organization to partner with the SMS Organization in cultivating engagement within their specific group or function. 2.

Job Hazard Analysis (In Development) The Job Hazard Analysis project is in development and will be released in 2026. A Job Hazard Analysis (JHA) is a technique that focuses on job tasks as a way to identify hazards before they occur. It focuses on the relationship between the worker, the task, the tools, and the work environment. A JHA is a structured, detailed approach that outlines each task step in a procedure along with the associated hazards and corresponding mitigation measures/controls. This tool is used as a training and discussion tool during TSB meetings to reinforce procedural awareness.

It takes about 20 seconds to complete. Loss of focus after completing the Circle of Safety may be a factor in collisions with stationary objects. This may result from doing other tasks such as viewing a cell phone during the Circle or doing other tasks between completing the circle and driving off. Checking for locked bins, correctly secured loads, trailer hitch attachments, etc. are completed prior to beginning the Circle, not during. This will keep the focus on recognizing possible hazards and allow the driver to eliminate or avoid them. The Circle of Safety applies to every stop, every place, every day. This includes, but is not limited to, the yard at a base, parking lots at headquarters locations, job sites, customer’s homes, or businesses, and if you take a Company vehicle home, there as well. Walk completely around vehicle. Walk counterclockwise (against traffic) if parked on a traveled roadway so that you can see oncoming traffic. Make a complete circle including looking under the vehicle, searching for things that you could hit or run over. Get in the vehicle. Fasten seat belt. Start vehicle. Check your mirrors. Look over your shoulder. Look forward. Put gear shift in drive and go within 15-20 seconds. Your surroundings can change quickly - If you do not leave the location within 15-20 seconds after performing a Circle of Safety, an additional Circle of Safety is required prior to departing to ensure the environment has not changed. Safety indicators like traffic cones and steering wheel covers can serve as reminders to perform a Circle of Safety. If you need a Circle of Safety reminder, order a vehicle steering wheel cover thorough your local storeroom [N656319].

Types of Safety Incidents and Events Safety Incidents are employee injuries, illnesses, and motor vehicle incidents (MVI). Types of injuries and illnesses include doctor visits, first aid incident, report only. Motor vehicles incidents include controllable, non-controllable, or de minimis, Other Events include Good Catches, Near Misses, and Stop-the-Jobs. Supervisors are responsible for evaluating every employee injury/illness or hazardous materials exposure and Motor Vehicle Incidents (MVI). Other events may also trigger an evaluation and follow-up such as a Good Catch, Near Miss or Stop-The-Job. Some minor incidents may not merit an incident evaluation, consult with your Field Safety Advisor. To review safety statistics, refer to the Safety Dashboard Directory Safety Incidents All workplace injuries and safety incidents must be reported and documented. The Safety Information Managements System (SIMS) is the primary system of record: Supervisors document incident details in SIMS within 24 hours. Click here for the instructions. Supervisors must immediately notify their Field Safety Advisor (FSA) of the employee injury/illness: Requires in-patient hospitalization. Results in the loss of any member or partial member of the body. Results in any serious degree of permanent disfigurement. Causes death. Cal-OSHA must be notified by the Safety department within 8 hours of the Company's knowledge.",

      "title": "When work related injuries, illnesses, or discomfort need to be reported:",
      "content": "A work-related injury or illness occurs when an employee is injured performing work, aggravates a pre-existing condition while performing work or becomes ill due to workplace exposure. Any time an employee reports an injury/ illness or discomfort, supervisors must offer the employee the opportunity to receive first aid care by an occupational health nurse (OHN) or medical care under Workers' Compensation. Contact your Employee Care Services representative (ECS). For more information regarding Workers Compensation, visit the ECS Supervisors Tips SharePoint site. Discomfort refers to any physical pain or soreness caused by work related tasks. Some medical situations ALWAYS require IMMEDIATE professional attention, including but not limited to: Uncontrolled bleeding or hemorrhaging - Call 911 Fainting or seizures - Call 911 Vomiting when working outdoors in hot weather - Call 911 Injuries that MAY require IMMEDIATE attention by a medical professional, depending on severity, include but not limited to: Eye injury Blow to the head Fall from height Adverse reaction to medication Animal bite that breaks the skin Second-degree or third-degree burn; or Puncture wound Major Incidents Contact your Field Safety Advisor, Employee Care Services (ECS) and the Legal and Claims Department for guidance regarding incidents that result in death, injuries requiring hospitalization, (for other than observation) or significant property or environmental damage. These incidents may require resources beyond that of a local incident evaluation. Refer to the Event Learning Process (ELP) GS 223.0032, Event Learning Process (ELP), for additional information regarding root cause analysis methods for major incidents. Doctor Visit Incidents Doctor visit is when an employee receives any level of treatment from an external medical source (e.g., external industrial clinic, urgent care, hospital, or paramedics). If an employee with a previously reported first-aid injury requests medical attention due to the same incident or states they cannot work or perform their job; treat the injury as a \"Doctor Visit,\" update SIMS as appropriate, and contact Employee Care Services (ECS). ECS will determine if the injury is \"OSHA Recordable\". First Aid Incidents First Aid is an injury or illness that is minor in nature or could require a doctor's care in the future. The affected employee, another trained employee, or internal OHN service provider can render first aid care. Supervisors must evaluate minor injuries to identify actions that can be taken to prevent a more serious injury from occurring in the future. This is done through a Safety Review Period where OHN, Supervisor and the affected employees work together to ensure successful first aid care and use of administrative control to prevent discomfort or injury from becoming more severe. Supervisors must follow up with an injured employee to see if they require further medical treatment regularly. Ask if the employee would like to: see an OHN, go to an industrial clinic, see their personal doctor, or if they have already been evaluated by a doctor. Immediately notify Employee Care Services (ECS) if the injured employee has seen, or plans to see, an industrial clinic or personal doctor. Report Only Incidents An incident occurrence where the employee made direct contact with object and could have sustained an injury or illness but does not currently require First Aid (minor injury) or medical treatment. If an employee declines medical treatment, document the injury or illness in SIMS as \"Report Only\". Lost Time Incidents Injuries that prevent employees from reporting to work for their next scheduled shift (the workday after the day the injury occurred) are classified as \"Lost Time Incidents.\" All Lost Time Incidents are also OSHA Recordable incidents. OSHA Recordable Incidents Employee Care Services (ECS) will determine if an injury that resulted in a Doctor Visit is OSHA Recordable based upon standards established by the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Cal-OSHA). California Public Utility Commission (CPUC) / Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) Incidents For incidents involving pipeline related emergencies, refer to GS 183.07, Pipeline Incident Reports to CPUC and PHMSA; National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Accident Investigation. Motor Vehicle Incident (MVI) A motor vehicle incident (MVI) is an event involving a Company owned or leased/rental motor vehicle that results in death, injury, or property damage. Reporting exceptions for an MVI as determined by local management, supervisor, and Field Safety Advisor (FSA): A vehicle that is properly and legally parked. No damage to Company property, Company vehicle or 3rd parties. The use of a Company owned or leased/rental vehicle was for personal use during the incident. All motor vehicle incidents are initially categorized as MVIs until the incident evaluation is complete and the Field Safety Advisor and Supervisor agree on a classification which will be one of the following: Controllable Motor Vehicle Incident (CMVI) - is a motor vehicle incident over which the driver had control (could have prevented). Any employee contribution to the incident causes the incident to be \"controllable.” If the driver did not do everything reasonably possible to prevent the incident, it is defined as \"controllable\" and should have been prevented. De Minimis - is a classification that includes CMVIs. This classification was developed to provide \"statistical relief\" from incidents over which there is no injury, no 3rd party property damage and damage to Company property is less than $1,000. The $1,000 value is consistent with California Vehicle Code (CVC) requiring traffic accidents on a California street/highway or private property to be reported to the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) if there was an injury, death, or property damage in excess of $1,000. Non-Controllable Motor Vehicle Incident (NC-MVI) - is an incident involving a motor vehicle that is deemed beyond the control of the driver (the driver could not prevent it). Legal liability or \"fault\" is not a primary consideration in determining controllability. The possibility that other causes for an incident exist is not considered proof an employee could not have prevented an incident. Incidents that occur at drive-thru establishments are considered \"controllable.\" Vehicles involved in incidents that occur in parking lots and on private property must have been there for Company business.

Lunch (other than approved business lunches) and breaks are not considered Company business. EXCEPTION: In areas where there is no available street parking within 100 yards (about a ninety-second walk), at supervisor discretion employees may park Company owned or leased/rental vehicles in remote parking lot areas. Any damage to, or caused by, a Company vehicle or personal vehicle being used for company business must be documented on Form 439 and submitted to the Claims department. The incident evaluation results must be documented in SIMS. Reference: American National Standards Institute ANSI D.16-2017: Manual on Classification of Motor Vehicle Traffic Crashes. Serious Injury or Fatality (SIF) Potential Program SoCalGas adopted the Edison Electric Institute (EEI) Safety Classification and Learning (SCL) Model to help in the identification and classification of potential serious injuries and fatalities. This model supports a common understanding of safety learning opportunities. Incidents classified as Potential Serious Injury or Fatality (PSIF) are further evaluated by trained PSIF Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). Safety Management make the final PSIF determination. When PSIFs have been identified they are reviewed for learning prioritization. Suggested edits: PSIFs event will be evaluated through the Incident Evaluation Process, refer to IIPP.7, Appendices, Appendix D. If a deep dive is warranted, they will proceed through the Event Learning Process, refer to OS 223.0032 for details. The identification and enhanced evaluation process allows for PSIF prioritization of incident causal factors to determine corrective actions that significantly mitigate employee exposure to SIFs. The following four questions must be answered to determine PSIF classification. Which high-energy was present? Was there a high-energy event? Was a serious injury sustained? Was a direct control present? PSIF training is available for Supervisors through My Learning. Incident Evaluation Safety Incidents are employee injuries and illnesses and motor vehicle incidents. Types of injuries and illnesses include doctor visits, first aid incident, report only. Motor vehicles incidents include controllable, non-controllable, de minimis. Other Events also include Good Catches, Near Misses, Stop-the-Jobs. Supervisors are responsible for thoroughly evaluating incidents and identifying all contributing factors. Supervisors together with the other incident evaluation team members determine the corrective actions that will be implemented to prevent similar incidents from reoccurring. Supervisors are responsible for evaluating every employee injury/illness or hazardous materials exposure and Motor Vehicle Incidents (MVIs). Other events may also trigger an evaluation and follow-up such as a Good Catch, Near Miss or Stop-The-Job. Some minor incidents may not merit an incident evaluation, consult with your Field Safety Advisor. Supervisors are responsible for establishing an incident evaluation team, minimally comprised of the immediate supervisor, the supervisor's manager, the involved employee, another employee (preferably from the local Safety Committee or Union), and a Safety department representative. The department head must be invited to participate when the incident resulted in lost time, restricted duty, or significant property damage. Supervisors refer to IIPP.7, Appendices, Appendix D, and the “Incident Evaluation Guide\" for more detailed information. Incident Evaluation Tree An incident evaluation must be completed for each safety incident (injury/illness, MVI). Other events may also trigger an evaluation such as a Good Catch, Near Miss or Stop-the-Job. This includes creating a Cause Analysis Tree and uploading the report in SIMS. Some minor incidents may merit an incident evaluation, consult with your Field Safety Advisor. Conduct the evaluation as soon as possible, while the facts are still fresh in people’s minds and the incident site is relatively unchanged. Prompt evaluations demonstrate that you place a high value on safety, For more information on the incident evaluation process refer to: IIPP.7, Appendices, Appendix D Incident Evaluation Guide. Training for Incident evaluation is available through My Learning. Drug or Alcohol Abuse If there is a reasonable suspicion of substance abuse, employees supervisors must contact a Wellness Programs representative. Good Catch There are many benefits to reporting Good Catches or Near Misses and sharing them with others. Understanding the causes of these events and, more importantly, the actions that can be taken to prevent them from recurring, provide the opportunity to prevent injuries and incidents. These events can be shared by entering them into the Safety Information Management System (SIMS). Good Catch: A Good Catch is an observation, event or situation that has the potential to cause injury, illness, or property damage, but did not occur thanks to timely intervention by an engaged individual or the presence of an effective control. A Good Catch is when you see something and correct it immediately. A Good Catch can prevent a Near Miss or Stop-The-Job.",

Safety administers the Company ergonomics program. The goal of the program is to reduce Repetitive Motion Injuries (RMI), while providing a work environment that meets workforce needs. Click the link for more information: Ergonomics Program (Repetitive Motion Injury (RMI) Prevention Program) The elements of the ergonomics program include Office and Field Ergonomics Office Ergonomics Training The company offers web-based Office Ergonomics Training. Training includes self-assessments and training tools to help participants identify risk factors associated with computer use, workstation set-up, body positioning, and stretching. Supervisors must review risk factors identified via self-assessments with subordinates and coach them regarding preventing Repetitive Motion Injuries. If additional equipment is needed, Supervisors should contact a Field Safety Advisor. In-Person Ergonomic Evaluations Job Safety Observation forms and Office Worker Observation forms have elements of ergonomics principles included within them. Supervisors must use these tools to reinforce proper ergonomics principles with employees and make changes to work tasks or workstation set-up when necessary. Controls Supervisors must provide employees with the proper training, equipment, and work environment to perform their jobs safely and efficiently. Supervisors must also see that employees adhere to ergonomic principles in adjusting workstations to fit themselves. Supervisors may request support from a Field Safety Advisor. New equipment, facilities, or workplace designs are to be presented to the Safety department for evaluation prior to implementation. When appropriate, Supervisors are to request Safety and Employee Care Services (ECS) jointly determine the appropriate accommodations for employees who have had a Repetitive Motion Injury (RMI). Field Ergonomics Field ergonomics program training is designed to equip each employee with a consistent process for approaching each job safely by enhancing knowledge, skills, and abilities on how to identify and use proper body mechanics. Use proper body mechanics and lifting techniques. When lifting heavy objects, use the large leg muscles instead of back muscles. See Ergonomics for additional details and resources for Field and Office Ergonomics. Supervisors can obtain field ergonomics training to support the reduction of sprains and strains by implementing proper ergonomic principles. Contact a Field Safety Advisor for training support.

When Exposure Occurs Employees immediately notify their supervisor or next-line Company representative when they have on-the-job exposure to another's blood or body fluids. Supervisors must immediately offer the Hepatitis B vaccine to the exposed employee and notify Employee Care Services (ECS) and a Company Occupational Health Nurse (OHN). If the exposed employee opts to take the vaccine, the supervisor ensures the employee is taken or goes to the nearest Industrial Clinic or OHN office within 24 hours of the Incident. Employees who decline the vaccine must fill out the form entitled Hepatitis B Vaccine Declination and return to ECS. If an employee initially declines the vaccination and subsequently requests it, the supervisor arranges for the employee to receive it as soon as possible.

Working in excavations where objects can fall or fly. Working in excavations with shoring. Structural damage to buildings is present. Overhead construction work is being performed. Overhead construction equipment is in use; or Performing traffic control. Inspect hard hats and suspension prior to use each day and promptly replace them when necessary. When inspecting your hard hat look for cracks, dents, and cuts/gauges in the shell. Check the suspension for cut or frayed straps, cracks, or tears in the plastic. Follow the manufacturer’s recommendations for replacement. For hard hats exposed to heat, sunlight, or chemicals, the shell may become chalky, dull, or have a crazing pattern or be less flexible (compare a new and used hard hat by flexing the brim). Prolonged exposure to sunlight will degrade most plastic shells. Do not store them in direct sunlight when not in use. If any of these characteristics are exhibited, replace the hard hat shell and/or suspension immediately. Hard hats struck by an object must be replaced immediately (both shell and suspension) and disposed of immediately, even if the damage is not visible. Prior to disposal of defective or expired hard hat, remove SoCalGas logo sticker. Pressure sensitive, non-metallic stickers or tape with self-adhesive backing are acceptable on most of today’s hard hats. However, there are some general requirements to follow: Do not use stickers to cover up hard hat damage, and place stickers at least ½ inch from the helmets edge. Hard hat shells must not be painted unless you receive specific approval by the manufacturer. Do not use paints, solvents, chemicals, adhesives, gasoline, or similar substances on this hard hat. Bandanas, bandanas, skullcaps, hoods, or welder’s caps that do not contain metal parts should be used only if they are worn smoothly on the top of the head. Care should be taken to avoid pressure points because the suspension should still be adjusted to provide a snug and comfortable fit. Baseball-style caps may not be worn; they will interfere with the ability of the suspension to work properly during an impact. Winter liners can be worn but should be inspected to ensure they do not adversely affect the proper fit or function of the hard hat. Do not store objects between the suspension and the shell of the hard hat because they may affect the protection capabilities of the unit. To provide maximum protection, the hard hat must fit securely on the head and the suspension should be adjusted to a snug fit. Never alter, puncture, modify, or engrave the shell or suspension of a hard hat.",

Training - (required once for each type of truck) demonstrations performed by the trainer with practical maneuvering/lifting exercises performed by the trainee. Operator Evaluation - A written operator evaluation with each different type of powered industrial truck must be conducted to assure training effectiveness as well as the operator knowledge and skill. The “Operator Evaluation” is a test where the operator must drive the industrial truck while being observed. Evaluations must be conducted once every three years or after refresher training. Experienced forklift operators are not required to go through formal instruction unless refresher training is required. Classroom training can be conducted using the Instructor's Training Guide. The guide was developed to assist field instructors in qualifying forklift/PIT operators. Contact Field Training to schedule a Train-the-Trainer Class. Use the Powered Industrial Truck (PIT) Operator Evaluation Form to record the operator's knowledge and skill in operating a powered industrial truck. Inspection Before operating any Powered Industrial Truck (PIT), such as a forklift, drivers must either perform a pre-use inspection or confirm that an inspection has already been completed during the current shift by reviewing the PIT inspection form for that day. If the PIT has not been inspected, or the form cannot be reviewed, it must be inspected before use regardless of the time of day or proposed length of use and the results recorded. In multi-shift operations, the PIT shall be inspected prior to use in each shift where it is to be used, regardless of the time of day or proposed length of use, and the results recorded. If defects are discovered, they shall be reported immediately to a supervisor or mechanic and the PIT shall not be operated until it has been made safe. If a previously uninspected PIT needs to be used later in a shift, see #1, above. If a PIT is not used during a particular day or shift, inspection is not necessary. All inspections must be documented on the DAILY CHECKLIST. Checklists are kept locally for one year.

Hearing Conservation Program Supervisors are responsible for ensuring all employees in the Hearing Conservation Program have their annual audiometric test and receive training to reduce their risk of occupational hearing loss. Specific job classifications exposed to noise levels at or above 85 decibels for an 8-hour time-weighted average are enrolled in the program. If a supervisor suspects noise levels are at these levels (general rule of thumb you need to shout at a distance of 3 feet to be heard), and the job classification is not in the program, contact your Field Safety Advisor to request an evaluation. Additional information including the job classification list in the program can be found on the Safety SharePoint site: Programs/Hearing Conservation and GS 166.04, Hearing Conservation Program. Respiratory Protection Program Supervisors are responsible for ensuring all employees in the Respiratory Protection Program complete their medical pre-screening (which includes a medical questionnaire and spirometry testing), receive respirator training, and are fit-tested to wear a respirator. Respirators are worn to control exposure to airborne hazards which can include dusts, fibers, fumes, mists, gases, vapors, biological material, and oxygen deficient atmospheres. Additional information including a list of job classification in the program and operations where respirators are required can be found on the Safety SharePoint site: Respirator Program and in GS 104.06, Respiratory Protection Program. Asbestos and Lead Exposure Supervisors are responsible for prohibiting employees from removing or disturbing asbestos materials. Exception: Employees with proper training and equipment may remove brake shoes, brake clutches, gaskets, and less than 100 square feet of asbestos coal tar pipe wrap. See Environmental & Safety GS 104.05, Asbestos Management. When asbestos materials are encountered, supervisors are to contact Environmental Services for the removal of asbestos or lead. Environmental Services has blanket contracts with abatement contractors and industrial hygiene consultants whose services will be used for this purpose. Supervisors are responsible for prohibiting employees from removing or disturbing paint containing lead or other metals. Assume all paint contains lead or other metals. Exception: Employees with proper training and equipment may remove less than 100 sq. ft. of paint containing lead or other metals using specific work controls and methods, or use lead-containing materials such as packing, sealants, and anti-seize compounds. See Safety GS 167.30, Lead and Metals in Surface Coatings and Other Sources: Hazard Compliance Program.

Employees are expected to follow all safety signage, secure work zones, and use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) to prevent accidents and minimize risk. In the event of an emergency, such as a suspected gas leak or fire, employees must follow emergency response procedures, notify the appropriate authorities, and assist in evacuating the area if necessary. Public trust is built on our commitment to safety, and every action we take reflects our dedication to protecting lives and property. NOTE: Inconvenience to the Public must not be given priority and/or precedence over Employee and/or Public Safety Fall Hazards Fall hazards pose a serious risk not only to employees but also to the public, especially in areas where utility work is conducted near sidewalks, streets, or other accessible locations. All employees must take proactive steps to prevent slips, trips, and falls by maintaining clean, organized work areas and securing tools and materials. When working at heights or near open trenches, proper fall protection equipment must be used, and barriers or warning signs should be clearly placed to keep the public at a safe distance. Any unsafe conditions, such as uneven surfaces or unsecured ladders, must be addressed immediately. By staying alert and following fall prevention protocols, we help ensure a safe environment for everyone in the vicinity of our operations. Job Site Intrusion Jobsite intrusions present a significant safety risk to both employees and the public. Unauthorized individuals entering active work zones can be exposed to hazardous conditions such as open trenches, pressurized gas lines, heavy equipment, and other dangers. To prevent intrusions, all job sites must be clearly marked with appropriate signage, barriers, and, when necessary, flaggers or security personnel. Employees should remain alert and report any unauthorized entry immediately to a supervisor. Engaging with intruders should be done calmly and professionally, prioritizing safety and de-escalation. Maintaining a secure perimeter not only protects the public but also ensures that work can proceed safely and without interruption. 3. People Leaders Employee Safety Training and Safety meetings (Supervisor) Conducting Employee Safety Training and Safety Meetings Supervisors must ensure each employee under their supervision are well trained, able to recognize job hazards, implement appropriate controls, and understand how to perform assigned tasks safely.

Identifying and Correcting Workplace Hazards - Supervisor For general information, refer to Identifying and Correcting Workplace Hazards By way of training or experience, a supervisor must be knowledgeable of applicable policies, standards, and procedures. Supervisors must readily use their knowledge and authority to correct at-risk conditions or actions. At-risk conditions or actions refer to behaviors or events that increase the likelihood of accidents, injuries, or negative outcomes. Supervisors must understand gas standards and safety regulations and stay informed of changes affecting the operations they supervise. Supervisors are responsible for regularly inspecting employee work practices and taking action to correct any at-risk conditions or behaviors. Job Safety Observation checklists can be used to document Supervisor observations, conditions or actions requiring modification, and corrective actions. Job Safety Observations help Supervisors identify and measure safe and at-risk work site conditions and employee actions compared to established criteria. Safety recommends that Supervisors perform a minimum of two Job Safety Observations on every frontline employee a year. However, Job Safety Observations should be performed as often as the Supervisor deems necessary to be confident hazardous conditions are identified and controls are in place. Supervisor Job Safety Observations provide an opportunity for employees to receive feedback regarding hazard identification, employee actions, and coaching as to how to perform work tasks safely. Environmental Safety Compliance Management Program (ESCMP) The State of California requires regularly scheduled workplace inspections. Some tools and equipment such as cranes, hoists and certain machine guards must be inspected at specified intervals. Refer to GS 167.33, Safety Inspections and Environmental Safety Compliance Management Program (ESCMP) Safety Self-Assessments, Safety Inspections and ESCMP Safety Self-Assessments for guidance.

Employees must avoid contact with potentially infectious materials such as animal carcasses, sewage, bio-solids, syringes, and liquids or surfaces contaminated by human or animal blood, waste or fluids, or respiratory aerosols/droplets. Requirements for protection against infectious agents transmitted in respiratory aerosols/droplets are outlined in section 13. 2. Look before working in areas where potentially infectious materials may be found or abandoned, such as in or around remote building sites, equipment, meters, vaults, or bushes. 3. Protective gloves and eye protection must be used to prevent skin/eye contact where contaminated materials cannot be avoided, and work must be conducted. Additional protective garments and equipment, such as a half face air purifying respirator with a P100 filter, must be used if ingestion and/or inhalation are possible routes of exposure (refer to GS 104.06 Respiratory Protection Program). Additional protective measures may also be needed in the event of a declared public health emergency regarding animal disposal. 4. Scoop or place contaminated material in suitable containers. Animal carcasses should be wetted with a bleach solution (1 ½ cup of household bleach per gallon of water) and placed in double-layered 6-mil plastic bags. IMPORTANT: DO NOT TOUCH, MOVE, OR BLEACH AN EAGLE CARCASS! Instead, immediately contact Environmental Services Natural Resources staff. 5. Contaminated work surfaces and tools must be disinfected with chlorine bleach solution (1 ½ cups of household bleach per gallon of water) or other disinfectants before work continues by unprotected employees. Disinfectants must be adequately removed or rinsed to prevent skin irritation. 6. Employees must use good personal hygiene, including washing hands with soap and water before eating, drinking, smoking, or leaving the work area. 7. Contaminated clothes should be machine washed separately in hot water, detergent, and household bleach. 8. If an employee is just near sewage, there is no exposure. If an employee is exposed to sewage through eyes, skin, or cut, follow these procedures: a) Notify the supervisor as soon as practical b) Immediately remove contaminated clothing. c) Do not take clothing home; put it in a plastic bag for routine laundering. d) Soak clothing in (1½ cups of bleach per gallon of water) for 30 minutes before sending it to the laundry. e) Wash boots with soap and water as soon as possible. f) Wash hands and affected area with soap and water as soon as possible. In the field, use the waterless hand cleaner (\"Scrub in a Bucket\") immediately. g) Wash with soap and water as soon as possible. Avoid touching mouth, eyes, or food until washing. 9. Sewage Treatment Plant bio-solids are usually the dry-treated solids from the plants that have been spread on the soil. During routine work activities around bio-solids, follow these guidelines: a) Never eat, drink, or smoke between handling bio-solid and washing hands b) Don't smoke, chew tobacco or gum while working in the area c) Avoid touching the face or eyes before washing hands d) Keep cuts covered",

Incorporating the safety-focused elements below can bring curiosity, collaboration, and safety into each meeting. These ideas increase communication and reflect our commitment to doing the right thing every day. Use techniques that are appropriate for the purpose of the meeting, the needs of the participants, and the allotted time. Opening a Meeting with Safety in Mind Each meeting should incorporate a review of emergency procedures including emergency exits, the location of AED and First Aid Kits, and the role of each person in case of an emergency. Safety Moments A Safety Moment Is a brief, focused discussion that highlights a safety topic, a specific workplace hazard or best practice for working safely. It aims to improve communication, increase knowledge, reinforce safety procedures, and motivate employees to prioritize safety. The Culture Contrarian/Devil’s Advocate A devil's advocate or “Culture Contrarian” is someone assigned to intentionally challenge ideas, assumptions, and decisions, during a meeting, to foster critical thinking and ensure all potential risks and alternatives are considered. The Plus/Delta Meeting Summaries The Plus/Delta technique is a powerful feedback tool used to promote continuous improvement by reflecting on what went well and what could be improved in a given activity, meeting, or process. It involves capturing meeting feedback in two columns: the “Plus” side captures successes, strengths, or positive outcomes, while the “Delta” side identifies areas for improvement, or refinement.",

This commitment is reflected in everything we do from initial employee training to the installation, operation, and maintenance of our utility infrastructure, and in how we provide safe and reliable service to our 22 million customers.\n\n\n\nThe Company and employees must comply with all applicable federal, state, regional, municipal, and local laws, ordinances, rules, codes, regulations, and executive orders as well as SoCalGas policies and standards.\n\n\n\nMessage from Leadership\n\nWe are Safer Together advancing a culture that empowers communication, curiosity, commitment, and collaboration.\n\nSoCalGas is fully committed to safety as a core value. SoCalGas’s leadership is responsible for overseeing reported safety concerns and promoting a strong, healthy safety culture and an environment of trust that includes empowering all employees to identify and mitigate risks and hazards and to “Stop-the-Job” if they cannot be sufficiently mitigated.\n\n\n\n\nUse Instructions\n\nThe Safety Manual for Employees provides an overview of SoCalGas’ safety culture, policies, and procedures. It is intended as a reference guide and does not replace official company standards or procedures. Many sections are summarized, with links to more detailed documentation for specific processes and procedures.\n\nAs an employee of SoCalGas, you are expected to be curious and ask questions, collaborate on improving our safety manual, field guides, resources, policies, and procedures, and communicate any safety suggestions or issues, and commit to safety for everyone.\n\nSome links in this manual depend on having access to the internet and internal SoCalGas resources. Review all relevant safety information before going into the field where access to the internet may be unreliable.\n\nThe key to continuous improvement is receiving your feedback. Your input is valuable in ensuring your safety, your coworkers’ safety, and the safety of our communities.\n\nClick the link to share your ideas: Safety Suggestion Submission Form. Suggestions are assigned to a responsible person who will follow-up with the submitter.\n\nThe Safety Organization updates the Manual and associated safety guidelines and policies annually.\n\nQuestions about the content of this manual should be directed to: SafetyMgmt@SoCalGas.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. SoCalGas’ Approach to Safety\n\nCommunication team will add Executive Messaging.\n\nExample: At SoCalGas, comprehensive safety means being relentless about identifying and mitigating risk. It also means protecting you, the communities we serve, our infrastructure, and our contractor partners.\n\n- Cedric Williams, Chief Safety Officer\n\nThe following sections define and clarify SoCalGas’s approach to Safety, a combination of policies, programs, documentation, and training that work together to help every employee focus on a new and expanded view of Safety.\n\nDefinition of Safety\n\nSoCalGas defines safety as the presence of controls for known hazards, actions to anticipate and guard against unknown hazards, and the commitment to continuously improve our ability to recognize and mitigate hazards.\"\n\nSoCalGas’ strives to view safety comprehensively, and takes a broad, proactive approach, reaching beyond ‘compliance only’ thinking.\n\nWhile compliance is important, safety is more than blindly following the rules. We look at safety holistically. Including the EPIC principles (Employee safety, Public safety, Infrastructure safety, and Contractor safety) and other elements such as environmental, process safety, cyber security, and asset security.\n\nWe do not achieve safety by simply removing a short-term risk or implementing an immediate corrective action focused on a specific situation. We assess and respond to each and every situation and use that assessment to strengthen systems, processes, planning, and operations to prevent future incidents.\n\nWe understand that true safety comes from continuously building capacity, resilience, and adding positive elements that make us ready for tomorrow.\n\nSafety Culture\n\nA company's culture refers to the shared values, beliefs, behaviors, and norms that shape how employees interact, make decisions, and work together within an organization. It’s often described as “how things are done around here.”\n\nOur Culture North Star – We are Safer Together when we know the system, know our roles and know when to act.\n\nSafer Together represents the “how” - our values, beliefs, norms, and behaviors.\n\nTogether, the Safety Management System (SMS) and our culture support our commitment to safety and shape how we communicate, collaborate, and show curiosity by asking “why.” It is essential that our guiding documents and our culture work in tandem to drive meaningful safety outcomes.\n\n\n\nEmployee, Public, Infrastructure, Contractor Safety (EPIC)\n\nSafety is everything we do across the enterprise. From office support roles to work in the field, we seek to recognize and mitigate hazards and keep our Employees, the Public, our Infrastructure, and our Contractors safe. The focus of many safety programs is on the personal safety of employees. However, there are multiple facets to safety that are foundational to our ability to deliver energy SAFELY to California. When we shift our meaning of safety to, everything we do, every day, it reflects that we all have a role in safety and safety outcomes.\n\nPsychological Safety\n\nPsychological Safety is the belief that your voice, and every person’s voice, is welcomed and valued, and that work-related concerns, ideas, or questions can be raised without fear of embarrassment, punishment, or other negative outcomes.\n\nAt SoCalGas, we promote a Speak-Up culture where everyone is encouraged to share ideas, call out unsafe conditions, such as Stop-the-Job actions, and contribute to improvement efforts. We encourage employees to speak up when in meetings or town halls. The concerns of our employees need to be heard to promote a culture of safety where every voice matters.\n\nA curious and collaborative environment is supported by our safety champions and local safety committees and reinforced during planning, training, and staff meetings as well as safety-focused meetings such as Tailgate Safety Briefings.\n\nPsychological safety boosts engagement, strengthens collaboration, and encourages open communication. When employees feel safe to speak up and ask questions, creativity and productivity thrive -leading to more innovative and effective teams.\n\nStop-the-Job (STJ) Policy\n\nThe Stop-The-Job policy requires a culture of psychological safety and ethical standards and empowers employees to speak up about potential hazards by stopping the job when a hazardous condition or unsafe action is observed.\n\nAll Company employees have the responsibility to respect and adhere to any decision to Stop-the-Job. No one should fear reprisal simply for stopping a job in good faith. Under no circumstances will retaliation of any kind be directed toward any employee who in good faith exercises their authority to Stop-the-Job. The company recognizes that people are fallible and blame fixes nothing.\n\nAll Company employees, contractors, and visitors have the authority and responsibility to stop any work activity that poses a risk (encountering a hazardous condition or unsafe act) that could endanger Employees, the Public, our gas Infrastructure including equipment and facilities, or Contractors (EPIC).\n\nClick the link for additional information: Stop-the-Job (SharePoint)\n\nHuman and Organizational Performance (HOP)\n\nAt SoCalGas, our comprehensive view of safety incorporates the Human and Organizational Performance Principles (HOP). HOP is not about placing blame; it is about understanding why an incident or event happened in the first place. HOP looks at the whole system, the team, the tools, the environment, to figure out how to prevent unsafe situations. By examining all the factors involved, we aim to create safer and more efficient processes.\n\nThe five basic principles of HOP are:\n\nError is normal: People make mistakes, and it is a normal part of the human condition to forget things or lose focus. Instead of trying to be “error free” we should strive to create better conditions for work and systems that allow us to fail safely without causing a catastrophe.\n\nBlame fixes nothing: Blaming or judging an employee for an error gets in the way of learning and developing as an organization. People will not be forthcoming with details that we can learn from if they are blamed for the error.\n\nContext drives behavior: When we talk about context driving behavior, we mean that people’s actions make sense in the environment and conditions under which they work. If we ask the right questions and are curious enough, we will see why an error occurred and how choices made led to the actions taken. So instead of placing blame, let’s ask questions to learn the “why” of the situation.\n\nLearning is vital: Learning is vital and goes hand in hand with context driving behavior and blame fixing nothing. Instead of looking for someone to blame, ask questions to find out about the context of the situation and discover the reason behind the behavior so we learn from and share this with others. We cannot change the system if we don’t learn from past behaviors.\n\nResponse matters: We often react to a situation in an automatic fashion by looking for someone or something to blame, or by not giving the situation the attention it deserves. This blocks us from really learning from experiences. Responding to errors by asking questions and looking into the context of the situation allows us to learn more about how to improve conditions and make things safer for everyone.\n\n\n\nBlack Line/Blue Line Analysis\n\nIn the context of operational safety in the gas industry, the Black Line / Blue Line graph is a conceptual tool used to illustrate the difference between \"Work as Planned\" and \"Work as Done.”\n\n Here's a working definition tailored for your domain:\n\nBlack Line / Blue Line Graph – Working Definition\n\nThe Black Line represents \"Work as Planned,” the procedures, policies, and expectations laid out by management, safety protocols, and engineering designs.\n\nThe Blue Line represents \"Work as Done\", the actual practices and adaptations made by frontline workers in real-world conditions, often in response to dynamic environments, constraints, or unforeseen challenges.\n\nAdaptation due to constraint: Workers adjust due to limited resources or environmental factors.\n\nImprovisation under pressure: Quick decisions made to maintain safety or productivity under stress.\n\nRed Line: Cumulative Risk, increases as deviations from the Black Line accumulate, highlighting areas of operational vulnerability.\n\nPurpose in Operational Safety\n\nThis graph is used to:\n\nIdentify gaps between planned procedures and actual execution.\n\nUnderstand operational realities that may not be captured in formal documentation.\n\nImprove safety culture by acknowledging and learning from frontline adaptations.\n\nSupport continuous improvement by aligning procedures with practical realities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSafety Management System (SMS)\n\nThe Safety Management System (SMS) is a structured framework with established roles and responsibilities used to manage safety comprehensively, systematically, and in an integrated manner. The SMS is a system that helps everyone -from top management to front-line employees -working together to prevent incidents and keep people and our infrastructure safe. It includes clear policies, procedures, and tools for identifying hazards, reporting issues, and continuously improving safety practices. SMS also defines roles and responsibilities and promotes collaboration across the enterprise by breaking down silos. Simply put, the SMS is everything we do to keep everyone and everything safe.\n\nThe Safety Manual for Employees support operational controls as discussed in the SMS.\n\nWhen it comes to safety, SMS is the “what” - our procedures, processes, programs, and policies.\n\nLink to SMS Manual when published.\n\nSafety Governance and Committees \n\nExecutive Safety Council\n\nThe Executive Safety Council (ESC) provides leadership guidance in fostering a proactive safety culture where risk identification and mitigation, management review, and continuous improvement are considered in support of SoCalGas’ Safety Management System (SMS).\n\nThe ESC monitors safety performance, promotes alignment with API RP 1173, and oversees the Safety Management System (SMS) to sustain implementation, improve risk management, and drive continuous improvement.\n\nLocal and Regional Safety Committees\n\nSafety Committees are made up of team members from different departments within a facility, district, or organization, who work together to help strengthen the company’s safety culture. They are close to the work being performed and are professionals in what they do. As your peers, they care about doing the job safely and helping others do the same.\n\nThey lead by example, speak up about safety, and encourage others to do the right thing.\n\nThey help identify areas for improvement and share ideas that can make work safer and more efficient.\n\nThey work closely with local leadership, safety advocates, and safety champions to share feedback from their workgroups and spread important safety messages.\n\nMembers of the Safety Committees aren’t responsible for making all the changes themselves, but they are go-to people in their area who keep safety as a priority and make sure voices are heard.\n\nSafety Committees are established to promote a safe and healthy work environment by identifying and addressing safety concerns, fostering communication between employees and leadership, and ensuring compliance with safety regulations and best practices.\n\nSafety Committees promote the idea that employee, public, infrastructure, and contractor safety (EPIC) is everyone’s responsibility.\n\nClick the link for additional information: Guidelines for Establishing District and Department Safety Committees\n\nSafety Champion Network\n\nSafety Champions are a diverse selection of key and influential management employees from across the Company that enhance the development and enterprise-wide adoption and integration of safety fundamentals, culture, and initiatives.\n\nSafety Champions represent various operational and functional departments and are ambassadors for safety, influence by example, identify opportunities for improvement, and inspire others to make positive changes. Safety Champions serve a vital role in the development, implementation, and enhancement of organizational safety processes.\n\nThese individuals are not necessarily responsible for the changes themselves but serve as points of contact from around the organization to partner with the SMS Organization in cultivating engagement within their specific group or function.\n\n2. Safety Programs/Procedures\n\nSection 2.1: All Environments (Office/Field)\n\nIIPP (Cal/OSHA Program)\n\nThe Injury Illness Prevention Program and Manuals are for managers, supervisors, and employees to assist in establishing and sustaining a safe and healthful work environment. The manual outlines responsibilities and tells where to find the information needed to prevent/reduce employee injuries and motor vehicle incidents.\n\nIncluded is the Injury and Illness Prevention Program which outlines the eight key elements required by Cal-OSHA.

The practice focuses on promotion and restoration of health, prevention of illnesses and injuries, and protection from work related and environmental hazards.\n\nOHN Services include:\n\nCare - Treatment, follow up, referrals, and first aid for work-related and non-work-related injuries and illnesses.\n\nAdvocacy - Liaisons for health services, rehabilitation, return-to-work and medical care issues.\n\nSafety - Detecting worker and workplace hazards.\n\nEducation - On employee health and wellness issues, encouraging workers to take responsibility for their own health.\n\n\n\nClick the link for additional information: Occupational Health Nurse and Telemedicine\n\nSafety Training and Safety Meetings\n\nSafety education and training for all employees commence at the time of employment. Before employees begin their duties, supervisors or designated instructors must train them on Company safety policies and how to perform their job properly, recognize the job hazards and that they are prepared to work safely.\n\nSafety information can be communicated through 1:1 training, job shadowing, coaching sessions, workgroup discussions, job observations and instructions on Good Catch, Near Miss and Stop-the-Job reporting.\n\nAll employees must attend/complete safety training as assigned.\n\nMinimum Meeting Schedules: \n\nEvery 10 days\n\nEmployees engaged in field construction or construction associated activities.\n\nMonthly \n\nEmployees involved in operations, maintenance, or other manual work (Employees who spend at least 50% of their time in the field).\n\nClick the link for more information: Employee Safety Training and Safety meetings (Supervisor)\n\nObservations\n\nJob Safety Observation and Coaching\n\nJob Safety Observations help employees identify and measure safe and at-risk work site conditions and employee actions compared to established criteria. The Safety organization recommends that Supervisors perform a minimum of two Job Safety Observations with every frontline employee per year. The goal is to provide effective coaching techniques to sustain safe behaviors and encourage positive adjustments.\n\nJob Safety Observations should be performed in a manner to build a feeling of psychological safety and trust between the supervisor and employees. Supervisor Job Safety Observations provide an opportunity for employees to receive feedback regarding hazard identification, employee actions, and coaching as to how to perform work tasks safely.\n\nSupervisors are responsible for regularly inspecting employee work practices and taking action to correct any at-risk conditions or behaviors. Job Safety Observation checklists can be used to document supervisor observations, conditions or actions requiring modification, and corrective actions.\n\nObservations should be conducted as often as the supervisor deems necessary to be confident hazardous conditions are identified and controls are in place.\n\nThis program is not a “gotcha” moment, it is an opportunity for the supervisor and observed employee to have open, two-way communication.\n\nClick the link for additional information: Job Safety Observations and Coaching\n\nHazard Recognition\n\nHazard Identification & Mitigation Management\n\nHazard recognition is the process of identifying potential sources of harm or danger in a workplace or work environment. It involves:\n\nIdentifying hazards by spotting anything that could potentially cause injury, illness, or damage.\n\nAssessing risks by evaluating the likelihood and severity of harm that could result from the hazards.\n\nImplementing direct controls or safeguards by taking steps to eliminate or reduce the risks associated with the hazards.\n\nRecognizing hazards effectively is crucial for maintaining a safe and healthy environment, whether you’re working in the field or in an office. It is a dynamic and proactive activity as we are always identifying and addressing potential dangers to help prevent accidents and injuries.\n\nHazard Recognition tools include the following: Hazard Recognition Energy Wheel, The Winning 7 Habits for Injury Prevention, Tailgate Safety Briefings, Job Hazard Analysis (In development - 2026).\n\nEnergy Wheel\n\nRadiation\n\n\n\n\n\nChemical\n\n\n\n\n\nTemperature\n\n\n\n\n\nGravity\n\n\n\n\n\nMotion\n\n\n\n\n\nMechanical\n\n\n\n\n\nElectrical\n\n\n\n\n\nPressure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick the link to get more information: Hazard Recognition - In Development\n\nTailgate Safety Briefings\n\nTailgate Safety Briefings (TSBs) are collaborative, in-depth discussions at a job site with all individuals involved with the job.\n\nTSBs can be led by the person-in-charge (e.g., crew lead, foreman) or a designated employee.\n\nTSBs are intended to communicate and reinforce safety awareness and immediate job-site hazards, make sure the scope of work is understood, and the job site is safe (for employees, the public, our infrastructure, and our contractors)\n\nTSBs are conducted immediately before the job starts, daily or per shift, especially before high-risk tasks or when conditions change.\n\nA site to support the TSB program will be available at the conclusion of the first pilot:\n\n Click the link to get more information: Tailgate Safety Briefing (TSB) - Work in Progress\n\nTailgate Safety Briefing Observation \n\nA process to assess if Tailgate Safety Briefings increases a team’s focus on hazards, supports a more comprehensive understanding of safety, and advances a questioning and learning environment.\n\nFor example, a positive Tailgate Safety Briefing would include dialogue on the work, risks, and potential hazards; consider comprehensive safety impacts (e.g., specifically non-occupation safety aspects like potential impacts to the public); and show psychological safety.\n\nTailgate Safety Briefings (TSB) include hazard recognition/energy wheel hazards. Eight of the ten energy wheel items fall under the high-energy classification.\n\nClick the link for additional information: Tailgate Safety Briefing Observation Form\n\nHigh-Energy Control Assessment (HECA) Observation\n\nThe HECA observation standard is in development and will be released in 2026.\n\nThe High-Energy Control Assessment (HECA) is a new leading metric that aligns with the industry ‘s best practices utilizing a standard methodology to conduct High-Energy Control Assessments (HECA).\n\nHigh-Energy Control Assessments (HECAs) are structured evaluations designed to identify, assess, and mitigate risks associated with high-energy systems and processes within construction. These systems include, but are not limited to, high-pressure gas lines, rotating equipment, electrical systems, and thermal processes. HECA is a critical component of a comprehensive safety management system, ensuring that energy sources are effectively controlled to prevent harm to personnel, assets, and the environment.\n\nSound and Biological energies are not considered high-energy, however, they have associated hazards and should be considered.\n\nJob Hazard Analysis (In Development)\n\nThe Job Hazard Analysis project is in development and will be released in 2026.\n\nA Job Hazard Analysis (JHA) is a technique that focuses on job tasks as a way to identify hazards before they occur. It focuses on the relationship between the worker, the task, the tools, and the work environment.\n\nA JHA is a structured, detailed approach that outlines each task step in a procedure along with the associated hazards and corresponding mitigation measures/controls.\n\nThis tool is used as a training and discussion tool during TSB meetings to reinforce procedural awareness.\n\nIdeally, after you identify uncontrolled hazards, you will take steps to eliminate or reduce them to an acceptable risk level.\n\nJHA documentation is developed by a subject matter expert, procedure owner, competent person, or designated employees.\n\nClick the link to get more information: Job Hazard Analysis (In Progress)\n\nJob Site Safety Plan\n\nA Job Site Safety Plan (JSSP) serves as a comprehensive safety framework designed to guide all operations on a jobsite throughout the duration of a project. It is particularly essential for large-scale or long-term projects where multiple teams and contractors are involved. The JSSP ensures that safety practices are consistent, thorough, and aligned with regulatory standards, providing a centralized reference for all safety-related procedures and expectations.\n\nThe plan promotes a coordinated and compliant approach to safety by incorporating structured processes such as Task Safety Briefings (TSBs) and Job Hazard or Safety Analyses (JHA/JSA). These tools help identify and mitigate risks associated with specific tasks and ensure that all personnel are aware of potential hazards before work begins. The JSSP is a living document that evolves with the project and must be formally documented and signed by leadership, including general contractors and safety managers, to demonstrate accountability and commitment to a safe work environment.\n\nKey components of the JSSP include the identification of site-specific hazards, clearly defined roles and responsibilities, and detailed emergency response procedures. It also outlines training requirements and communication protocols to ensure that all workers are informed, prepared, and engaged in maintaining a safe job site. These elements work together to create a proactive safety culture that minimizes risk and enhances overall project efficiency.\n\nClick the link to get more information: Contractor Safety Program\n\nHazard Communication Program (HazCom) and Safety Data Sheets (SDS)\n\nA Hazard Communication Program (HazCom) is a formal program designed to ensure information about chemical hazards in the workplace is effectively communicated to employees.\n\nIts primary purpose is to protect workers from chemical-related injuries or illnesses by making them aware of the hazardous substances they may encounter, how to handle them safely, and what to do in case of exposure or emergency.\n\nAdditionally, chemical manufacturers and importers are required to evaluate the hazards of the chemicals they produce or import and prepare labels and safety data sheets (SDS) to convey the hazard information to their downstream customers.\n\nA Safety Data Sheet (SDS) is a standardized document that provides detailed information about hazardous chemicals.\n\nWithin a Hazard Communication Program, the SDS serves as the primary source of detailed safety information for each chemical.\n\nEmployers are required to:\n\nUse only company approved products.\n\nMaintain an accessible SDS for every hazardous chemical in the workplace.\n\nEnsure SDSs are readily available to all employees during their work shifts.\n\nUse SDSs to inform training programs, emergency response planning, and risk assessments.\n\nClick the link to get more information: Hazard Communication Program (HazCom).\n\nClick here for the Product Approval Process.\n\nSafe Driving Practices\n\nVehicle Operation Safety Rules\n\nThe following rules apply to any and all employees who operate Company vehicles or who operate non-Company vehicles on company business.\n\nOnly authorized people are to operate Company vehicles.\n\nOperate all vehicles in compliance with the California Motor Vehicle Code, Motor Carrier Safety Regulations and Company procedures.

Keep the vehicle interior, including the dash and truck bed, neat and orderly when the vehicle is in motion.\n\nDo not exit a vehicle when the engine is running. \nIf the driver is not in the driver’s seat, the vehicle engine may be running only when:\n\nIt is necessary to leave the vehicle running to perform work.\n\nThe vehicle transmission is in Park or Neutral\n\nThe vehicle’s parking brake has been set.\n\nWhen wheel chocks have been placed as described below:\n\nOn level ground wheel chocks are placed in front and behind a wheel or wheels.\n\nOn non-level ground wheel chocks are placed on the down-hill side of at least two wheels.\n\nChocks are placed as close to tires as possible and directly in line with the tire.\n\nChocks are removed immediately prior to beginning the Circle of Safety.\n\nAll vehicles with dual rear wheels require wheel chocks when unattended or parked. The duration of parking is not considered.\n\nMotor vehicle keys are not to be left in an unattended vehicle unless the vehicle is being used to perform work.\n\nPark vehicles in locations that prevent possible damage. Avoid parking opposite a driveway, curved road, or blind corner. Avoid parking in mini-mall stalls and drivethrough restaurant stalls.\n\nException: When a vehicle is used as a physical barrier. See Vehicle Intrusion.\n\nAlways place the vehicle transmission in “Park” and set the parking brake before exiting the vehicle.\n\nDo not hang anything on the above-bed exhaust systems of construction vehicles.\n\nKeep natural gas emergency shut off-valves accessible and clear.\n\nDrive company vehicles with headlights or running lights on. While on company business, operate personal vehicles with headlights or running lights on, unless this reduces the visibility of safety-critical dashboard displays.\n\nAvoid backing vehicles if possible. Use pull-through parking to avoid backing when it’s available. When backing is necessary or otherwise required, do it upon arrival, unless it is at risk to do so or otherwise prohibited. Backing guides are required to be used anytime full rear visibility cannot be obtained and there are multiple crew members.\n\nWhile refueling vehicles with gasoline, diesel, or natural gas quick-fill, employees shall remain outside of the vehicle within arm’s reach of the fueling nozzle. Natural gas slow-fill vehicles are exempt. If the fueling nozzle has a built-in latching mechanism to hold it in the open (flow) position it may be used. Fueling nozzles without built-in latching mechanisms may not be held in the open position by any means other than the employee’s hand.\n\nA Circle of Safety must be completed immediately prior to departure from all fueling areas (Gasoline/Diesel fuel islands, natural gas quick-fill, natural gas slow-fill etc.).\n\nLock vehicle bin doors before putting the vehicle in motion, whenever the vehicle is left unattended, or when it is parked in the yard at the end of a work shift. Promptly report to your supervisor and to Fleet if there are broken or inoperable bin door locks.\n\nEach frequent driver must be enrolled in the “Defensive Driving” program. (See IIPP.2 Supervisor Responsibilities, Defensive Driving, for training requirements.)\n\nWho is Required to take Training? Training is mandatory for all \"frequent\" Company drivers per the IIPP. A \"frequent\" driver is an employee who: drives a Company or personal vehicle as a requirement of their job, OR drives more than 3,000 business miles per year, documented in expense report mileage records, OR assigned by leadership.\n\nDrive defensively in accordance with the Smith System eLearning program.\nSmith System®Driving\n\n\nRefer to SoCalGas Vehicle Policy for more information.\n\nSMITH 5 Keys\n\n1. Aim High in Steering: Look ahead for a minimum of 15 seconds.\n\n2. Get the Big Picture: Check at least one of your mirrors every five to eight seconds and while scanning ahead, do not forget the sides and rear.\n\n3. Keep Your Eyes Moving: Focusing on any object for too long diminishes your peripheral vision.\n\n4. Leave Yourself an Out: When possible, surround your vehicle with space and if you lose part of the cushion, work to keep at least the front and one side open.\n\n5. Make Sure They See You: Seek eye contact by using the warning devices on your vehicle.\n\nFor more information, please visit the Defensive Driving SharePoint site\n\nCircle of Safety\n\nImmediately before moving the vehicle, walk around the vehicle (i.e., perform the “Circle of Safety”) to ensure no hazards exist.\n\nThe Circle of Safety is an independent, single-focused task required to be completed by all employees who operate Company vehicles and those employees who use their personal vehicles for Company business. It takes about 20 seconds to complete.\n\nLoss of focus after completing the Circle of Safety may be a factor in collisions with stationary objects. This may result from doing other tasks such as viewing a cell phone during the Circle or doing other tasks between completing the circle and driving off.\n\nChecking for locked bins, correctly secured loads, trailer hitch attachments, etc. are completed prior to beginning the Circle, not during. This will keep the focus on recognizing possible hazards and allow the driver to eliminate or avoid them.\n\nThe Circle of Safety applies to every stop, every place, every day. This includes, but is not limited to, the yard at a base, parking lots at headquarters locations, job sites, customer’s homes, or businesses, and if you take a Company vehicle home, there as well.\n\nWalk completely around vehicle.\n\nWalk counterclockwise (against traffic) if parked on a traveled roadway so that you can see oncoming traffic.\n\nMake a complete circle including looking under the vehicle, searching for things that you could hit or run over.\n\nGet in the vehicle.\n\nFasten seat belt.\n\nStart vehicle.\n\nCheck your mirrors.\n\nLook over your shoulder.\n\nLook forward.\n\nPut gear shift in drive and go within 15-20 seconds.\n\nYour surroundings can change quickly - If you do not leave the location within 15-20 seconds after performing a Circle of Safety, an additional Circle of Safety is required prior to departing to ensure the environment has not changed.\n\nSafety indicators like traffic cones and steering wheel covers can serve as reminders to perform a Circle of Safety. If you need a Circle of Safety reminder, order a vehicle steering wheel cover thorough your local storeroom [N656319].\n\nGet out and Look (GOAL)\n\nTo eliminate blind spots when backing or pulling forward, Get Out-and-Look (GOAL). This safety practice prevents controllable motor vehicle incidents (CMVIs). This safety practice helps to minimize blind spots and reduce the risk of collisions.\n\nWe Value Safe Driving / Telematics / Advanced Safety Analytics\n\nClick here for more information on Vehicle Operation Safety Rules\n\n\"We Value Safe Driving\" is a program designed to enable supervisors to reinforce safe driving habits and correct at-risk habits. All Company vehicles must display the 1-800-GAS-SAFE bumper sticker in a conspicuous location on the rear of the vehicle.\n\nThe public may call 1-800-GAS-SAFE to provide feedback on observed driving habits. Supervisors are to evaluate all comments and communicate findings with employees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe Value Safe Driving\n\nHow am I Driving?\n\n1-(800)-GAS-SAFE\n\nSafety provides bumper stickers for all current company vehicles. Fleet provides and affixes the stickers to all new vehicles. The 1-800-Gas-Safe number is monitored by Dispatch. Dispatch summarizes caller feedback and forwards it via e-mail to Safety. Safety routes the report to the employee's supervisor for evaluation and action. Copies are sent to two levels of management above the supervisor and the appropriate Field Safety Advisor.\n\nTypes of Incident reports\n\nEmergency Reports require an immediate response. These calls involve dangerous conditions or an emergency situation such as a motor vehicle incident, item falling from a Company vehicle, etc.\n\nDriver Performance Reports require supervisory action and possible correction.\n\nClick the link to get more information: Incident Reporting\n\nSupervisors’ Responsibilities\n\nCommunicate the program with employees.\n\nEnsure that all Company motor vehicles have the \"We Value Safe Driving\" bumper sticker conspicuously visible on the rear of the vehicle.\n\nPerform periodic inspections to ensure that bumper stickers have not been concealed or removed.\n\nConduct a thorough analysis of the We Value Safe Driving reports. To the extent possible, validate whether the callers report is accurate and named employee was operating the vehicle at the time of the report.\n\nProvide employees with feedback regarding reported driving habits.\n\nPrepare a brief description documenting the analysis and follow-up action(s) and send via e-mail to the Safety department.\n\nTypes of Safety Incidents and Events\n\nSafety Incidents are employee injuries, illnesses, and motor vehicle incidents (MVI). Types of injuries and illnesses include doctor visits, first aid incident, report only. Motor vehicles incidents include controllable, non-controllable, or de minimis, Other Events include Good Catches, Near Misses, and Stop-the-Jobs.\n\nSupervisors are responsible for evaluating every employee injury/illness or hazardous materials exposure and Motor Vehicle Incidents (MVI). Other events may also trigger an evaluation and follow-up such as a Good Catch, Near Miss or Stop-The-Job. Some minor incidents may not merit an incident evaluation, consult with your Field Safety Advisor.\n\nTo review safety statistics, refer to the Safety Dashboard Directory\n\nSafety Incidents\n\nAll workplace injuries and safety incidents must be reported and documented. The Safety Information Managements System (SIMS) is the primary system of record:\n\nSupervisors document incident details in SIMS within 24 hours. Click here for the instructions.\n\nSupervisors must immediately notify their Field Safety Advisor (FSA) of the employee injury/illness:\n\nRequires in-patient hospitalization.\n\nResults in the loss of any member or partial member of the body.\n\nResults in any serious degree of permanent disfigurement.\n\nCauses death.\n\nCal-OSHA must be notified by the Safety department within 8 hours of the Company's knowledge.\n\nWhen work related injuries, illnesses, or discomfort need to be reported:\n\nA work-related injury or illness occurs when an employee is injured performing work, aggravates a pre-existing condition while performing work or becomes ill due to workplace exposure.\n\nAny time an employee reports an injury/ illness or discomfort, supervisors must offer the employee the opportunity to receive first aid care by an occupational health nurse (OHN) or medical care under Workers' Compensation.\n\nContact your Employee Care Services representative (ECS).\n\nFor more information regarding Workers Compensation, visit the ECS Supervisors Tips SharePoint site.\n\nDiscomfort refers to any physical pain or soreness caused by work related tasks.\n\nSome medical situations ALWAYS require IMMEDIATE professional attention, including but not limited to:\n\nUncontrolled bleeding or hemorrhaging - Call 911\n\nFainting or seizures - Call 911\n\nVomiting when working outdoors in hot weather - Call 911\n\nInjuries that MAY require IMMEDIATE attention by a medical professional, depending on severity, include but not limited to:\n\nEye injury\n\nBlow to the head\n\nFall from height\n\nAdverse reaction to medication\n\nAnimal bite that breaks the skin\n\nSecond-degree or third-degree burn; or\n\nPuncture wound\n\nMajor Incidents\n\nContact your Field Safety Advisor, Employee Care Services (ECS) and the Legal and Claims Department for guidance regarding incidents that result in death, injuries requiring hospitalization, (for other than observation) or significant property or environmental damage. These incidents may require resources beyond that of a local incident evaluation.\n\nRefer to the Event Learning Process (ELP) GS 223.0032, Event Learning Process (ELP), for additional information regarding root cause analysis methods for major incidents.\n\nDoctor Visit Incidents\n\nDoctor visit is when an employee receives any level of treatment from an external medical source (e.g., external industrial clinic, urgent care, hospital, or paramedics). If an employee with a previously reported first-aid injury requests medical attention due to the same incident or states they cannot work or perform their job; treat the injury as a \"Doctor Visit,\" update SIMS as appropriate, and contact Employee Care Services (ECS). ECS will determine if the injury is \"OSHA Recordable\".\n\nFirst Aid Incidents\n\nFirst Aid is an injury or illness that is minor in nature or could require a doctor's care in the future. The affected employee, another trained employee, or internal OHN service provider can render first aid care. Supervisors must evaluate minor injuries to identify actions that can be taken to prevent a more serious injury from occurring in the future. This is done through a Safety Review Period where OHN, Supervisor and the affected employees work together to ensure successful first aid care and use of administrative control to prevent discomfort or injury from becoming more severe.\n\nSupervisors must follow up with an injured employee to see if they require further medical treatment regularly. Ask if the employee would like to: see an OHN, go to an industrial clinic, see their personal doctor, or if they have already been evaluated by a doctor. Immediately notify Employee Care Services (ECS) if the injured employee has seen, or plans to see, an industrial clinic or personal doctor.\n\nReport Only Incidents\n\nAn incident occurrence where the employee made direct contact with object and could have sustained an injury or illness but does not currently require First Aid (minor injury) or medical treatment. If an employee declines medical treatment, document the injury or illness in SIMS as \"Report Only\".\n\nLost Time Incidents\n\nInjuries that prevent employees from reporting to work for their next scheduled shift (the workday after the day the injury occurred) are classified as \"Lost Time Incidents.\" All Lost Time Incidents are also OSHA Recordable incidents.\n\nOSHA Recordable Incidents\n\nEmployee Care Services (ECS) will determine if an injury that resulted in a Doctor Visit is OSHA Recordable based upon standards established by the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Cal-OSHA).\n\nCalifornia Public Utility Commission (CPUC) / Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) Incidents\n\nFor incidents involving pipeline related emergencies, refer to GS 183.07, Pipeline Incident Reports to CPUC and PHMSA; National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Accident Investigation.\n\nMotor Vehicle Incident (MVI)\n\nA motor vehicle incident (MVI) is an event involving a Company owned or leased/rental motor vehicle that results in death, injury, or property damage.\n\nReporting exceptions for an MVI as determined by local management, supervisor, and Field Safety Advisor (FSA):\n\nA vehicle that is properly and legally parked.\n\nNo damage to Company property, Company vehicle or 3rd parties.\n\nThe use of a Company owned or leased/rental vehicle was for personal use during the incident.\n\nAll motor vehicle incidents are initially categorized as MVIs until the incident evaluation is complete and the Field Safety Advisor and Supervisor agree on a classification which will be one of the following:\n\nControllable Motor Vehicle Incident (CMVI) - is a motor vehicle incident over which the driver had control (could have prevented). Any employee contribution to the incident causes the incident to be \"controllable.”\n\nIf the driver did not do everything reasonably possible to prevent the incident, it is defined as \"controllable\" and should have been prevented.\n\nDe Minimis - is a classification that includes CMVIs. This classification was developed to provide \"statistical relief\" from incidents over which there is no injury, no 3rd party property damage and damage to Company property is less than $1,000.\n\nThe $1,000 value is consistent with California Vehicle Code (CVC) requiring traffic accidents on a California street/highway or private property to be reported to the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) if there was an injury, death, or property damage in excess of $1,000.\n\nNon-Controllable Motor Vehicle Incident (NC-MVI) - is an incident involving a motor vehicle that is deemed beyond the control of the driver (the driver could not prevent it).\n\nLegal liability or \"fault\" is not a primary consideration in determining controllability.\n\nThe possibility that other causes for an incident exist is not considered proof an employee could not have prevented an incident.\n\nIncidents that occur at drive-thru establishments are considered \"controllable.\"\n\nVehicles involved in incidents that occur in parking lots and on private property must have been there for Company business. Lunch (other than approved business lunches) and breaks are not considered Company business.\n\nEXCEPTION: In areas where there is no available street parking within 100 yards (about a ninety-second walk), at supervisor discretion employees may park Company owned or leased/rental vehicles in remote parking lot areas.\n\nAny damage to, or caused by, a Company vehicle or personal vehicle being used for company business must be documented on Form 439 and submitted to the Claims department. The incident evaluation results must be documented in SIMS.\n\nReference: American National Standards Institute ANSI D.16-2017: Manual on Classification of Motor Vehicle Traffic Crashes.\n\nSerious Injury or Fatality (SIF) Potential Program\n\nSoCalGas adopted the Edison Electric Institute (EEI) Safety Classification and Learning (SCL) Model to help in the identification and classification of potential serious injuries and fatalities. This model supports a common understanding of safety learning opportunities.\n\nIncidents classified as Potential Serious Injury or Fatality (PSIF) are further evaluated by trained PSIF Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). Safety Management make the final PSIF determination. When PSIFs have been identified they are reviewed for learning prioritization.\n\nSuggested edits: PSIFs event will be evaluated through the Incident Evaluation Process, refer to IIPP.7, Appendices, Appendix D. If a deep dive is warranted, they will proceed through the Event Learning Process, refer to OS 223.0032 for details.\n\nThe identification and enhanced evaluation process allows for PSIF prioritization of incident causal factors to determine corrective actions that significantly mitigate employee exposure to SIFs.\n\nThe following four questions must be answered to determine PSIF classification.\n\nWhich high-energy was present?\n\nWas there a high-energy event?\n\nWas a serious injury sustained?\n\nWas a direct control present?\n\nPSIF training is available for Supervisors through My Learning.\n\nIncident Evaluation\n\nSafety Incidents are employee injuries and illnesses and motor vehicle incidents. Types of injuries and illnesses include doctor visits, first aid incident, report only. Motor vehicles incidents include controllable, non-controllable, de minimis. Other Events also include Good Catches, Near Misses, Stop-the-Jobs.\n\nSupervisors are responsible for thoroughly evaluating incidents and identifying all contributing factors. Supervisors together with the other incident evaluation team members determine the corrective actions that will be implemented to prevent similar incidents from reoccurring.\n\nSupervisors are responsible for evaluating every employee injury/illness or hazardous materials exposure and Motor Vehicle Incidents (MVIs). Other events may also trigger an evaluation and follow-up such as a Good Catch, Near Miss or Stop-The-Job. Some minor incidents may not merit an incident evaluation, consult with your Field Safety Advisor.\n\nSupervisors are responsible for establishing an incident evaluation team, minimally comprised of the immediate supervisor, the supervisor's manager, the involved employee, another employee (preferably from the local Safety Committee or Union), and a Safety department representative. The department head must be invited to participate when the incident resulted in lost time, restricted duty, or significant property damage.\n\nSupervisors refer to IIPP.7, Appendices, Appendix D, and the “Incident Evaluation Guide\" for more detailed information.\n\nIncident Evaluation Tree\n\nAn incident evaluation must be completed for each safety incident (injury/illness, MVI). Other events may also trigger an evaluation such as a Good Catch, Near Miss or Stop-the-Job. This includes creating a Cause Analysis Tree and uploading the report in SIMS.\n\nSome minor incidents may merit an incident evaluation, consult with your Field Safety Advisor.\n\nConduct the evaluation as soon as possible, while the facts are still fresh in people’s minds and the incident site is relatively unchanged. Prompt evaluations demonstrate that you place a high value on safety,\n\nFor more information on the incident evaluation process refer to: IIPP.7, Appendices, Appendix D Incident Evaluation Guide.\n\nTraining for Incident evaluation is available through My Learning.\n\nDrug or Alcohol Abuse\n\nIf there is a reasonable suspicion of substance abuse, employees supervisors must contact a Wellness Programs representative.\n\nGood Catch\n\nThere are many benefits to reporting Good Catches or Near Misses and sharing them with others. Understanding the causes of these events and, more importantly, the actions that can be taken to prevent them from recurring, provide the opportunity to prevent injuries and incidents.\n\nThese events can be shared by entering them into the Safety Information Management System (SIMS).\n\nGood Catch: A Good Catch is an observation, event or situation that has the potential to cause injury, illness, or property damage, but did not occur thanks to timely intervention by an engaged individual or the presence of an effective control.\n\nA Good Catch is when you see something and correct it immediately.\n\nA Good Catch can prevent a Near Miss or Stop-The-Job.\n\nClick the link to get more information: Submit a Good Catch or Near Miss\n\nNear Miss\n\nA Near Miss is an unplanned event that happened but did not result in an injury, illness or property damage but had the potential to do so.\n\nA Near Miss reported today enables learning and prevents an incident tomorrow.\n\nThe Near Miss reporting process may also be used to report damage to, or failure of equipment or facilities where neither injuries nor motor vehicle damage occurred.\n\nClick the link to get more information: Submit a Good Catch or Near Miss\n\nStop-the-Job Policy\n\nA Stop-the-Job is when an individual encounters an unsafe condition, action or behavior that cannot be immediately corrected and “Stop-the-Job” until effective controls are put in place.\n\nAny employee can Stop-the-Job. Under no circumstances will retribution of any kind be directed toward any employee who, in good faith, exercises their authority to Stop-the-Job.\n\nThe Stop-the-Job process is here: Stop-the-Job Process\n\nFor more information on Stop-the-Job, click here: Stop-the-Job\n\nIdentifying and Correcting Workplace Hazards\n\nAll employees should be involved with identifying and mitigating correcting workplace hazards whether it is the office, at home, or on-site.\n\nSupervisors must conduct workplace inspections to ensure employees are provided with a hazard-free work environment. This requires that Supervisors understand the work being performed and proactively and thoroughly identify potential hazards or unsafe action and take action to correct them.\n\nWhile Supervisors have specific responsibilities in the field, all on-site employees should understand the work being performed and proactively and thoroughly identify potential hazards or unsafe action and take action to correct them.\n\nBuilding and grounds inspections, tool and equipment inspections, vehicle inspections, and worksite job observations all provide opportunities for Supervisors and field teams to identify, assess, and resolve potential hazards and implement controls.\n\nHazard Identification and mitigation should be reviewed during the on-site Tailgate Safety Briefings (TSB) before each day’s work.\n\nEliminate all hazardous conditions or unsafe actions as quickly and thoroughly as possible. Hazardous conditions or unsafe actions pose an imminent threat to employees, the public, infrastructure, and contractors (EPIC). Stop-the-Job until the hazardous conditions are corrected.\n\nIf an employee identifies a hazardous condition or unsafe action, they cannot resolve safely themselves, it is their responsibility to Stop-the-Job.\n\nRefer to the Stop-the-Job Policy for more details.\n\nClick the link to get more information: Hazard Recognition Program\n\nFor more information on supervisor responsibilities, \nrefer to: Identifying and Correcting Workplace Hazards - Supervisor\n\nPrograms\n\nCyber Security\n\nThe mission of the Cyber Security team is to share cyber knowledge and promote the responsible use of technology through open dialogue, protecting our infrastructure and helping ensure resilience for a cyber safe future for you and our company.\n\nCybersecurity means protecting computers, networks, and data from being accessed or damaged by unauthorized people.

The goal of the program is to reduce Repetitive Motion Injuries (RMI), while providing a work environment that meets workforce needs.\n\nClick the link for more information: Ergonomics Program (Repetitive Motion Injury (RMI) Prevention Program)\n\nThe elements of the ergonomics program include Office and Field Ergonomics\n\nOffice Ergonomics\n\nTraining\n\nThe company offers web-based Office Ergonomics Training. Training includes self-assessments and training tools to help participants identify risk factors associated with computer use, workstation set-up, body positioning, and stretching. Supervisors must review risk factors identified via self-assessments with subordinates and coach them regarding preventing Repetitive Motion Injuries. If additional equipment is needed, Supervisors should contact a Field Safety Advisor.\n\nIn-Person Ergonomic Evaluations\n\nJob Safety Observation forms and Office Worker Observation forms have elements of ergonomics principles included within them. Supervisors must use these tools to reinforce proper ergonomics principles with employees and make changes to work tasks or workstation set-up when necessary.\n\nControls\n\nSupervisors must provide employees with the proper training, equipment, and work environment to perform their jobs safely and efficiently. Supervisors must also see that employees adhere to ergonomic principles in adjusting workstations to fit themselves. Supervisors may request support from a Field Safety Advisor.\n\nNew equipment, facilities, or workplace designs are to be presented to the Safety department for evaluation prior to implementation.\n\nWhen appropriate, Supervisors are to request Safety and Employee Care Services (ECS) jointly determine the appropriate accommodations for employees who have had a Repetitive Motion Injury (RMI).\n\nField Ergonomics\n\nField ergonomics program training is designed to equip each employee with a consistent process for approaching each job safely by enhancing knowledge, skills, and abilities on how to identify and use proper body mechanics.\n\nUse proper body mechanics and lifting techniques. When lifting heavy objects, use the large leg muscles instead of back muscles. See Ergonomics for additional details and resources for Field and Office Ergonomics.\n\nSupervisors can obtain field ergonomics training to support the reduction of sprains and strains by implementing proper ergonomic principles. Contact a Field Safety Advisor for training support.\n\nCPR/AED and First Aid\n\nThe Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR)/Automatic External Defibrillator (AED) and First Aid program provides first aid kits and AEDs for SoCalGas facilities, and CPR training to designated emergency responders. First aid kits and AED units are inspected and updated monthly.\n\nSoCalGas is required to have an adequate number of employees trained on crews and in occupied facilities to render first aid and provide CPR/AED in the absence of an infirmary, clinic, or hospital, in proximity to the workplace.\n\nPolicy\n\nFor more information about the AED, CPR, and First Aid, and Bloodborne Pathogen program: Click HERE\n\nTraining\n\nFirst Aid/CPR/AED/Bloodborne Pathogens training is facilitated through Pico Rivera training.\n\nAED Program\n\nClick the link to get more information: AED Program\n\nFirst Aid Kits\n\nFirst aid kits are to be readily available to employees at every jobsite.

Every employee plays a vital role in ensuring public safety by adhering to established safety protocols, promptly reporting hazards, and maintaining clear communication with both internal teams and the public. Whether responding to a gas leak, performing routine maintenance, or working near populated areas, employees must remain vigilant and prioritize the well-being of the public at all times.\n\nEmployees are expected to follow all safety signage, secure work zones, and use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) to prevent accidents and minimize risk. In the event of an emergency, such as a suspected gas leak or fire, employees must follow emergency response procedures, notify the appropriate authorities, and assist in evacuating the area if necessary.\n\nPublic trust is built on our commitment to safety, and every action we take reflects our dedication to protecting lives and property.\n\nNOTE: Inconvenience to the Public must not be given priority and/or precedence over Employee and/or Public Safety\n\nFall Hazards\n\nFall hazards pose a serious risk not only to employees but also to the public, especially in areas where utility work is conducted near sidewalks, streets, or other accessible locations. All employees must take proactive steps to prevent slips, trips, and falls by maintaining clean, organized work areas and securing tools and materials. When working at heights or near open trenches, proper fall protection equipment must be used, and barriers or warning signs should be clearly placed to keep the public at a safe distance.\n\nAny unsafe conditions, such as uneven surfaces or unsecured ladders, must be addressed immediately. By staying alert and following fall prevention protocols, we help ensure a safe environment for everyone in the vicinity of our operations.\n\nJob Site Intrusion\n\nJobsite intrusions present a significant safety risk to both employees and the public. Unauthorized individuals entering active work zones can be exposed to hazardous conditions such as open trenches, pressurized gas lines, heavy equipment, and other dangers.\n\nTo prevent intrusions, all job sites must be clearly marked with appropriate signage, barriers, and, when necessary, flaggers or security personnel. Employees should remain alert and report any unauthorized entry immediately to a supervisor. Engaging with intruders should be done calmly and professionally, prioritizing safety and de-escalation. Maintaining a secure perimeter not only protects the public but also ensures that work can proceed safely and without interruption.\n\n3. People Leaders\n\nEmployee Safety Training and Safety meetings (Supervisor)\n\nConducting Employee Safety Training and Safety Meetings\n\nSupervisors must ensure each employee under their supervision are well trained, able to recognize job hazards, implement appropriate controls, and understand how to perform assigned tasks safely. Employee training must be documented in our system of record: Learning Management System (LMS)\n\n1. General Safety Training\n\nThe law requires the Company to provide safety training for its employees. This training includes explaining safe work practices and instruction regarding hazards specific to each employee's job assignment.\n\nThis required training is provided:\n\na)\tTo all new employees.\n\nb)\tTo all employees given new job assignments for which training has not previously been received.\n\nc)\tWhenever new substances, processes, procedures, or equipment are introduced into the workplace and represent a new hazard.\n\nd)\tFor supervisors, to familiarize them with the Safety hazards to which employees under their immediate direction and control may be exposed to and how to communicate information about those hazards effectively and implement appropriate controls.\n\nWhen employees know how to perform their job properly, recognize the job hazards, and understand their supervisor's expectations, they are prepared to work safely.\n\n2. Training for New Employees\n\nSafety education and training for employees commence at the time of employment. Before employees begin an assigned task, supervisors or designated instructors must train them on Company safety policies.\n\nThis training must include:\n\na)\tAn explanation of the Company Safety Policy.\n\nb)\tFamiliarization with the Company's general safety rules and enforcement policies, including any specific requirements of the department where the employee will work.\n\nc)\tThe requirement for immediately reporting all injuries, including information regarding available medical treatment.\n\nd)\tThe requirement is that they report to supervision all at-risk practices and conditions encountered when working for the Company.\n\ne)\tInformation concerning safety training specific to their job duties.\n\nf)\tA clear statement that \"Employees shall not attempt to perform a job they believe to be unsafe or that puts their safety or that of others at risk\" (see Stop-the-Job).\n\ng)\tInstruction on any hazards associated with the employee's job; and\n\nh)\tThe requirement is that employees ensure all guards and other protective devices are in place and properly adjusted, and any deficiencies must be promptly reported to their supervisor.\n\nFor example, if personal protective equipment (PPE) is required on the job, it must be issued, and instructions provided in its use. It is best to follow up with a complete review and/or job observation within a week or two after assignment to the job. This will help verify the new employee fully understands the information provided at the time of employment and at the time of job assignment.\n\nFind the full list of safety training courses at: Safety Training Site\n\n3. Safety Meetings\n\nSupervisors must effectively communicate safety information during job observations, coaching sessions, and workgroup discussions (reference newsletters, Safety Bulletins, Safety Lesson Plans, Gas Standards, and training videos for this purpose).\n\nAll safety meetings must be of sufficient duration to cover the safety and injury prevention needs of the workgroup. The meeting topics must be relevant to the issues of the particular workgroup. It is recommended that the meeting size be such that the material covered is clear to, and understood by, every employee in attendance.\n\nMake-up meetings must be held for employees who are not in attendance when employee safety training material is provided. Refer to GS 166.004, Employee Safety Training.\n\nMinimum Meeting Schedules: \n\nEvery 10 days\n\nField Construction \n\nMonthly \n\nField and non-construction (employees who spend 50% or less of their time in the field)\n\nSupervisors should hold as many safety meetings as necessary to ensure employees are fully trained and understand how to perform their jobs safely.\n\nIdentifying and Correcting Workplace Hazards - Supervisor\n\nFor general information, refer to Identifying and Correcting Workplace Hazards\n\nBy way of training or experience, a supervisor must be knowledgeable of applicable policies, standards, and procedures. Supervisors must readily use their knowledge and authority to correct at-risk conditions or actions. At-risk conditions or actions refer to behaviors or events that increase the likelihood of accidents, injuries, or negative outcomes.\n\nSupervisors must understand gas standards and safety regulations and stay informed of changes affecting the operations they supervise.\n\nSupervisors are responsible for regularly inspecting employee work practices and taking action to correct any at-risk conditions or behaviors. Job Safety Observation checklists can be used to document Supervisor observations, conditions or actions requiring modification, and corrective actions.\n\nJob Safety Observations help Supervisors identify and measure safe and at-risk work site conditions and employee actions compared to established criteria. Safety recommends that Supervisors perform a minimum of two Job Safety Observations on every frontline employee a year. However, Job Safety Observations should be performed as often as the Supervisor deems necessary to be confident hazardous conditions are identified and controls are in place. Supervisor Job Safety Observations provide an opportunity for employees to receive feedback regarding hazard identification, employee actions, and coaching as to how to perform work tasks safely.\n\nEnvironmental Safety Compliance Management Program (ESCMP)\n\nThe State of California requires regularly scheduled workplace inspections. Some tools and equipment such as cranes, hoists and certain machine guards must be inspected at specified intervals. Refer to GS 167.33, Safety Inspections and Environmental Safety Compliance Management Program (ESCMP) Safety Self-Assessments, Safety Inspections and ESCMP Safety Self-Assessments for guidance.\n\nRecommended Safety Training for Supervisors\n\nJob Safety Observation & Coaching Training Course\n\nIncident Evaluation Training Course\n\nNew Supervisor Onboarding Program (NSOP)\n\nEmployees who transition into supervisory roles with direct reports are automatically enrolled in the NSOP curriculum through the LMS.\n\nLeadership Training Camp (LTC)\n\nLeadership Training Camp (LTC) is the second phase of the LEAD series. To be placed in the LTC queue, leaders must first complete the New Supervisor Onboarding Program (NSOP).\n\nLeadership Challenge (LC)\n\nLeadership Challenge is the third phase of the LEAD series. This course is nomination-based and available to leaders who have completed both NSOP and LTC.\n\nSafety Essentials for Leaders Course is a required course within NSOP.\n\nClick the link for more information: SoCalGas University - Home\n\nFacility Renovations \n\nFacility renovations may lead to employee injuries and illnesses unless effective planning is performed.\n\nFacility Supervisors and Construction Project Manager Responsibilities:\n\nNotify all local supervisors of the schedule of any construction as soon as practical prior to facility renovations that may involve odors, dusts, noise, or vibration.\n\nSend Safety Data Sheets (SDSs) to Safety for review before products are brought onto Company premises.\n\nConsider isolating employees' air supply from sources of potential air contaminants.\n\nArrange for asbestos/lead/dust air monitoring as required or necessary in areas where employees will be working during construction.\n\nConsider the impact on normal operations when deciding whether to schedule construction during night-time or weekends; and\n\nRefer to GS 167.04, Contractor Safety Program for more information.\n\nSupervisor Responsibilities:\n\nRequest Safety department assistance in determining if Company work can safely continue during construction. If not, supervisors have to make alternative arrangements.\n\nNotify employees of proposed construction dates and the scope of work.\n\nNotify employees of what they may expect to occur concerning odors, dusts, etc.\n\nDetermine if any affected employees have special health needs that require attention during construction activities.\n\nAdditional Resources for People Leaders\n\nClick the link for more information: Supervisor Resources\n\n\n\n\n4.

Incorporating the safety-focused elements below can bring curiosity, collaboration, and safety into each meeting. These ideas increase communication and reflect our commitment to doing the right thing every day.\n\nUse techniques that are appropriate for the purpose of the meeting, the needs of the participants, and the allotted time.\n\nOpening a Meeting with Safety in Mind\n\nEach meeting should incorporate a review of emergency procedures including emergency exits, the location of AED and First Aid Kits, and the role of each person in case of an emergency.\n\nSafety Moments\n\nA Safety Moment Is a brief, focused discussion that highlights a safety topic, a specific workplace hazard or best practice for working safely. It aims to improve communication, increase knowledge, reinforce safety procedures, and motivate employees to prioritize safety.\n\nThe Culture Contrarian/Devil’s Advocate\n\nA devil's advocate or “Culture Contrarian” is someone assigned to intentionally challenge ideas, assumptions, and decisions, during a meeting, to foster critical thinking and ensure all potential risks and alternatives are considered.\n\nThe Plus/Delta Meeting Summaries\n\nThe Plus/Delta technique is a powerful feedback tool used to promote continuous improvement by reflecting on what went well and what could be improved in a given activity, meeting, or process. It involves capturing meeting feedback in two columns: the “Plus” side captures successes, strengths, or positive outcomes, while the “Delta” side identifies areas for improvement, or refinement.\n\nClick the link for more information: Conducting a Meeting with Safety in Mind\n\n\n\n\nExample in the Gas Industry\n\nImagine a pipeline maintenance procedure that assumes ideal weather, full staffing, and all tools available (Black Line). In reality, workers may face rain, missing equipment, or time pressure, leading them to improvise or skip steps (Blue Line). The graph helps visualize and analyze these deviations to enhance safety and reliability.\n\nThis visualization helps safety professionals identify where and why deviations occur, enabling better alignment between planning and execution.\n\nThis visualization is especially useful for safety reviews, incident investigations, and proactive risk management in gas operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tSafety Manual for Employee - Review Copy - V2\tBaseline 8/15/25 - Printed on 1\tPage 31 of 65"
